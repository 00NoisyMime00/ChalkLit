Definition------------------
Centre of Mass. For a system of particles, the centre of mass is defined as that point where the entire mass of the system is imagined to be concentrated, for consideration of its translational motion. If all the external forces acting on the body/system of bodies were to be applied at the centre of mass, the state of rest/ motion of the body/system of bodies shall remain unaffected.

conditions for equilibrium!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Axis of Rotation. A rigid body is said to be rotating if every point mass that makes it up, describes a circular path of a different radius but the same angular speed. The circular paths of all the point masses have a common centre. A line passing through this common centre is the axis of rotation. A rigid body is said to be in equilibrium if under the action of forces/torques, the body remains in its position of rest or of uniform motion.For translational equilibrium, the vector sum of all the forces acting on a body must be zero. For rotational equilibrium, the vector sum of torques of all the forces acting on that body about the reference point must be zero. For complete equilibrium, both these conditions must be fulfilled.

law of gravitation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Newton’s Law of Gravitation Newton’s law of gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The direction of the force is along the line joining the particles.
Newton’s law of gravitation:- Every particle of matter in this universe attracts every other particle with a forcer which varies directly as the product of masses of two particles and inversely as the square of the distance between them. F= GMm/r2. Here, G is universal gravitational constant. G = 6.67 ´10 -11 Nm2 / kg2
Thus the Universal Law of Gravitation can be stated as: “Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force directed along the line of centers for the two objects that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the separation between the two objects”.

Universal Law Of Gravitation. According to Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation, the force exerted between two objects, by each other is given by the following relation. Fg∝m1.m2r2. Where, g: gravitational force between two bodies, m1: mass of one object, m2: mass of the second object, r: distance between the centers of two objects

acceleration of gravity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Acceleration Due to Gravity. The acceleration produced in a body on account of the force of gravity is known as acceleration due to gravity. It is usually denoted by ‘g’. It is always towards the centre of Earth. If a body of mass ‘m’ lying on the surface of the earth, the gravitational force acting on the body is given by
The acceleration of an object in free fall is directed downward, regardless of the initial motion
The magnitude of free fall acceleration (gravitational acceleration) is g = 9.80 m/s^2
g decreases with increasing altitude
g varies with latitude, height and depth from earth surface.
9.80 is the average at the Earth’s surface
The italicized g will be used for the acceleration due to gravity
Types------------------
Effects------------------
Examples------------------
Application------------------
Property------------------
Variation of Acceleration Due to Gravity. The value of acceleration due to gravity changes with height (i.e., altitude), depth, shape of the earth and rotation of earth about its own axis. (a) Effect of Altitude. As one goes above the surface of Earth, value of acceleration due to gravity gradually goes on decreasing. If gh be the value of acceleration due to gravity at a height h from the surface of Earth, then

Now the question is if gravitation exists between any two masses then why we are attracted towards the earth but not towards each other. To realize this let’s take an example let there be two bodies A (60 kg) and B (80 kg) at a distance of 1m from one another. So the gravitational pull between the two bodies is: F=Gm1m2r2⇒F=6.67×10−11×60×8012N⇒F=3.2×10−7N………………….(3) Now consider the force between body A and the earth. Mass = 6×1024 Kg. Radius of earth = 6.3×106 m. F=6.67×10−11×60×6×1024(6.3×106)2N⇒F=577.4N. By looking at (3) and (4), we can say that even though every bit of mass in the universe attracts every other bit, we don’t feel it because, under normal heights, the attraction is far too low to be felt. The Earth, on the other hand, is massive and hence exerts a non-zero force on us. The larger the planet, larger is its force of gravity.
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
Acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions when ball goes upward. Acceleration is uniform. Velocity is decreasing in upward motion (red arrows are getting shorter). Positive velocity and negative acceleration. Velocity becomes zero at maximum height. Time duration flight in going upward and coming back is always same.

Transformers

A transformer is a device that changes voltage  from one value to another.
Power at the input end  is equal to the power at the output end.
Only the voltage will increase or decrease
Types of Transformers

There are 2 types of transformers:-

Step up transformer:-

This transformer amplifies the voltage. The output is higher than the input which is being supplied.
This condition will be true Vs > Vp only when  Ns > Np and Ip < Is.
Vs = (Ns/ Np) Vp
The output of the transformer à  voltage will be high and current will be less.
They are used in the power stations which supply power to the houses.


Step down transformer:-

For Vs < Vp  to be true then  Ns < Np .
Is > Ip so  that (Pintput  = Poutput).
Output is low voltage and high current.
This transformer is used in welding

Transformer:- It is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltage into that at high voltage or vice versa.
If transformer increases the input voltage, it is called step-up transformer.
If transformer decreases the input voltage, it is called step-down transformer.
It works on the principle of mutual induction, i.e. when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.

Applications of Transformers

Transmission of power over long distances :-

Suppose there is a main power station, from there power is send to different sub area power stations and from there it is supplied to different houses.
At the main power station there is step-up transformer, it will amplify the voltage and current is reduced.
When the current is reduced therefore heating will be reduced to a great extent.
The power loss is minimized to a great extent till it reaches the area sub stations.
At the area substation step-down transformer is used. This transformer will reduce the voltage and then supplied to the houses.
The line power loss will be not very much as the distance between the houses and area power substation won’t be very large.


Transformers are used to regulate the voltage. Many appliances use voltage stabilizers which regulate the voltage so that the electronic devices are not harmed when there is fluctuation in the voltage.

flux leakage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Energy losses in actual transformers

Flux leakage:-

 There are air gaps between the primary and the secondary coils  because of which the change of flux which is associated with the primary coil is not completely transferred to secondary coil.
In order to reduce the loss secondary coil can be wound over the primary coil.
For example:- In case of toroidal transformer cores, over the primary coil secondary coil is wound above it. As a result there is no air gap in between them.

So the thick wires are used in the windings of primary and secondary coils as a result resistance will be less .
The amount of heat lost because of wires will be less as resistance is minimal.
Eddy currents:-

Soft Iron core also gets heated up because of magnetic flux as a result eddy currents are developed in the soft iron core.

Definition------------------
Huygens’ Principle Huygens’ principle is essentially a geometrical construction, which gives the shape of the wave front at any time, allows us to determine the shape of the wave front at a later time. According to Huygens’ principle,
(i) Every point on a wave front behaves like a light source and emits secondary wavelets.
(ii) The secondary wavelets spread in all directions in space (vacuum) with the velocity of light.
(iii) The envelope of wave front of secondary wavelets, after a given time, along forward direction gives the new position of wave front.
Huygens’ Principle:
According to Huygens’ Each point on the given wave front (called primary wave front) acts as a fresh source of new disturbance, called secondary wavelet, which travels in all directions with the velocity of light in the given medium.
A surface touching these secondary wavelets, tangentially in the forward direction at any instant gives the new wavefront at that instant. This is called secondary wavelets.

8. Huygens’ wave theory successfully explains the phenomenon of interference, diffraction and polarisation.
9. As, frequency v is characteristic of the source, therefore v = 1/T remains the same as light travels from one medium to another.
10. Wavelength is inversely proportional to refractive index (μ) of the medium

First the wave front touches the reflecting surface at B and then at the successive points towards C. In accordance with Huygens’ principle, from each point on BC, secondary wavelets start growing with the speed c. During the time the disturbance from A reaches the point C the secondary wavelets from B must have spread over a hemisphere of radius BD = AC = ct, where t is the time taken by the disturbance to travel from A to C. The tangent plane CD drawn from the point C over this hemisphere of radius ct will be the new reflected wave front.
Let angles of incidence and reflection be i and r, respectively . In AABC and ADCB, we have

i.e. the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The proves the first law of reflection.
Further, since the incident ray SB, the normal BN and the reflected ray BD are respectively perpendicular to the incident wave front AB, the reflecting surface XY and the reflected wave front CD (all of which are perpendicular to the plane of the paper) therefore, they all lie in the plane of the paper i.e. in the same plane.

The wave front first strikes at point A and then at the successive points towards C. According to Huygens’ principle, from each point on AC, the secondary wavelets starts growing in the second medium with speed v2. Let the disturbance take time t to travel from B to C, then BC = v1t. During the time the disturbance from B reaches the point C, the secondary wavelets from point A must have spread over a hemisphere of radius AD = v2t in the second medium. The tangent plane CD drawn from point C over this hemisphere of radius v2t will be the new refracted wave front.

This proves another law of refraction.
Principle of Huygens’ Construction:
It is based on the principle that every point on a wavefront is a source of secondary wavefront.
The envelope of these wavefronts i.e., the surface tangent to all the secondary wavefront gives the new wavefront.

In accordance with Huygens’ principle, from each point on BC, secondary wavelets start growing with the speed c.

Interference fringes with white light:- When the slits are illuminated with white light, the interference pattern consist of a central white fringe having on both sides a few coloured fringes and then a general illumination.
Interference

Interference is a phenomenon of superposition of 2 waves to form a resultant wave of greater, lower or the same amplitude.
When the crest of a wave overlaps the crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point, then the resultant amplitude will be the sum of the amplitudes of individual waves. Then it is known as constructive interference.
Amplitude of the resultant wave will be more as compared to the amplitude of individual waves.
When the crest of one wave meets the trough of another wave,then the resultant amplitude is given as difference of the two individual amplitudes.Then it is known as destructive interference.
Amplitude of the resultant wave will be less as compared to the amplitude of individual waves.
For example:-
If two stones are dropped in the river,ripples or wavesare generated by both stones.When both the waves overlap,there will be maximum displacement when the waves are in phase and there will be no displacement when they are out of phase.

diffraction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Diffraction:
The phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of an obstacle is called the diffraction of light.
Diffraction

Diffraction is the phenomenon by virtue of whichlight bendswhile passing through aslit or an opening.
The extent of bending depends upon the diameter of the slit.
Both Interference and Diffraction are closely related to each other.
Young replaced the two slits by a single slit in his single slit experiment.Therefore this experiment is also referred as Young’s single slit experiment.
When the light passed through one slit a different type of pattern was observed on the screen.
The pattern which was observed had a central maximum band and which was very wide as compared to interference pattern.
There were alternate dark and bright bands and their intensity was decreasing on both the sides.
The central maxima,was very wide whereas corresponding secondary maxima and minima were reduced in the intensity.
The change in the pattern was formed due to diffraction instead of interference.
Conclusion:-

Broad central bright band.
Alternate dark and bright bands on either side.
Intensity was decreasing on both sides.


Diffraction Fringe Pattern

In diffraction there is an incoming wave which passes through a single slit and as a result diffraction pattern was obtained on the screen.
  

Diffraction pattern Maxima

The incident wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit. This shows they are in phase with each other.
From the given figure:-
Path difference =NP – LP
=>NQ = a sinθ where a=width of the slit.
The slit was divided into smaller parts M1, M2, N and L, and when contribution from each part is added up.
At the central point θ =0. This implies path difference =0.
This means all the parts of the slit will contribute completely. Therefore the intensity is the maximum.
Central Maximum occurs at θ =0.
 

Problem:-The light of wavelength 600nm is incident normally on a slit of width 3mm.Calcluate the linear width of central maximum on a screen kept 3m away from the slit?

Answer:-

Wavelength λ =600nm =600 x10-9m.

Width of the slit a =3mm=3x10-3m.

Distance of the screen D=3m.

Condition for minima:-a sinθ =nλ

=>a sin θ =λ

=>sin θ = (λ/a) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=>θ =(600 x10-9)/(3x10-3)

=>(x/D) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=> x= (600 x 10-9 x3)/ (3 x10-3)

x=600 x 10-6m.

Therefore width =2x = 1200 x 10-6m

Width = 1.2 mm

Diffraction pattern Secondary Maxima

Scientist Fresnel found that secondary maxima occurred when the value of θ is:

θ =(n+(1/2)) (λ/a)
For n=1 =>θ =(3λ)/(2a) = (1.5λ/a) (equation 1)
Where = (3λ)/ (2a) it lies midway between 2 dark fringes.
Suppose if the slit is divided into 3 parts ,
Consider the first 2/3rd part of the slit ,
Path difference = (2/3) a x θ
=(2/3) a x(3λ/2a) using (equation 1)
Path difference =λ.
The λ is getting divide into 2 halves with path difference =λ/2 and λ/2.
Each of λ/2 gets cancel with another λ/2.
Contribution from (2/3rd) part gets cancel out with each other.
Therefore only (1/3rd) contributes to I(Intensity).
Intensity ≠ 0.
Intensity is reduced.
For n=2 => θ =(5 λ)/(a)
Only (1/5th) part will contribute.
For n=3 =>θ =(7 λ)/(2a)
Only (1/7th) part contributes.
 

Slit divided into 3 parts

 

Diffraction pattern for Minima

Condition to get minima on the diffraction pattern:
θ = (n λ/a); n= (+-) 1, (+-2)…
For n=1, =>θ = (λ/a)
Suppose the slit is divided into small parts. For every M1in the portion LM there exists another M2 in MN.
From the figure it is clear that the contribution from all elements inLM (M1) will cancel out the contribution from all elements MN (M2).
Therefore net intensity I=0 at θ = (λ/a).
Minima occur at θ = (nλ/a). => aθ =nλ
=> a sinθ =nλ.
Path difference = (nλ/a).
Minima will occur ata sin θ =n λ. Where a =width of the slit,λ = wavelength of the light used.

At the central point θ =0. This implies path difference =0.
This means all the parts of the slit will contribute completely. Therefore the intensity is the maximum.
Central Maximum occurs at θ =0.
 

Problem:-The light of wavelength 600nm is incident normally on a slit of width 3mm.Calcluate the linear width of central maximum on a screen kept 3m away from the slit?

Answer:-

Wavelength λ =600nm =600 x10-9m.

Width of the slit a =3mm=3x10-3m.

Distance of the screen D=3m.

Condition for minima:-a sinθ =nλ

=>a sin θ =λ

=>sin θ = (λ/a) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=>θ =(600 x10-9)/(3x10-3)

=>(x/D) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=> x= (600 x 10-9 x3)/ (3 x10-3)

x=600 x 10-6m.

Therefore width =2x = 1200 x 10-6m

Width = 1.2 mm

Diffraction pattern Secondary Maxima

Scientist Fresnel found that secondary maxima occurred when the value of θ is:

θ =(n+(1/2)) (λ/a)
For n=1 =>θ =(3λ)/(2a) = (1.5λ/a) (equation 1)
Where = (3λ)/ (2a) it lies midway between 2 dark fringes.
Suppose if the slit is divided into 3 parts ,
Consider the first 2/3rd part of the slit ,
Path difference = (2/3) a x θ
=(2/3) a x(3λ/2a) using (equation 1)
Path difference =λ.
The λ is getting divide into 2 halves with path difference =λ/2 and λ/2.
Each of λ/2 gets cancel with another λ/2.
Contribution from (2/3rd) part gets cancel out with each other.
Therefore only (1/3rd) contributes to I(Intensity).
Intensity ≠ 0.
Intensity is reduced.
For n=2 => θ =(5 λ)/(a)
Only (1/5th) part will contribute.
For n=3 =>θ =(7 λ)/(2a)
Only (1/7th) part contributes.
 

Slit divided into 3 parts

 

Diffraction pattern for Minima

Condition to get minima on the diffraction pattern:
θ = (n λ/a); n= (+-) 1, (+-2)…
For n=1, =>θ = (λ/a)
Suppose the slit is divided into small parts. For every M1in the portion LM there exists another M2 in MN.
From the figure it is clear that the contribution from all elements inLM (M1) will cancel out the contribution from all elements MN (M2).
Therefore net intensity I=0 at θ = (λ/a).
Minima occur at θ = (nλ/a). => aθ =nλ
=> a sinθ =nλ.
Path difference = (nλ/a).
Minima will occur ata sin θ =n λ. Where a =width of the slit,λ = wavelength of the light used.

Methods of producing plane polarised light:

Experiment 1:-Polarization by a single polaroid (P1)

When a beam of light passes through Polaroid was a polarized light.
Observations:

The intensity was almost halved. As half of light rays were not allowed to enter only few were allowed to pass through it.
Rotation of thePolaroid P1 has no effect on the intensity of transmitted light.
There will be many different orientations but all are present in equal amount.
Whatever is the direction of the Polaroidbut always the intensity of the lightcoming out of the Polaroid will be same.
Sometimes it will allow vertically polarized light to pass and sometimes horizontal.
Experiment 2:-Polarization by a two polaroid (P1,P2)

One more Polaroid(P2) was introduced in between the unpolarized light and Polaroid(P1).
Observations:

Intensity of the light is almost halved after P2.
When the polarized light enters the second Polaroid (P1) then
If the pass axis of the polarizer P1 is along the same direction as P2 then the light will come out of the Polaroid P1.
Intensity will remain same.
Rotation of the Polaroid P1 has effects on intensity of transmitted polarized light.
When the two axes are not oriented in the same direction i.e. if the axis of the P1 is perpendicular to the axis of the P2.
Then P1 won’t allow any light to pass through it as a result net intensity will be 0.
It concludes that :-
Transmitted intensity=0 when pass axis of P1 is perpendicular to P2.
Transmitted intensity=maximum when pass axis of P1 is parallel to P2.
Polaroid Experiment:Conclusion

Intensity of the polarized light varies with the angle between the pass axes of the two Polaroid.
I =0 whenθ =900.
I =max when θ=00.
As the angle increases from 00 to 900 the intensity keeps on decreasing.

Definition------------------
Polarization by Scattering:
Light is scattered when it meets a particle of similar size to its own wavelength. The scattering of sunlight by dust particles is an example of polarization by scattering.
Wave Optics Class 12 Notes Physics
Polarization by double refraction: When an unpolrised ray passes through certain crystals like quartz or calcite, it spilts up into two rays. This phenomenon is called double refraction.
Wave Optics Class 12 Notes Physics
Rayleigh showed that the scattering of light is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency of the light or varies as  where  is the wavelength of light incident on the air molecules of size ‘d’ where . Hence blue light is scattered more than red. This explains the blue colour of the sky.
Polaroids: Polaroids are thin commercial sheets which make use of the property of selective absorption to produce an intense beam of plane polarised light.
Uses of polaroids- In sunglasses and camera filters, In wind screens, In window panes of aeroplanes, In LCDs etc.

huygen's principle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Huygens Principle

Huygens principle states that each point of a wavefront is the source of secondary wavelets (small waves) which spread in all directions with the speed of the wave.
The new wavefront is formed by drawing a line tangent to all the wavelets.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
Examples------------------
For example:-

If a stone is thrown in the river,waves will be formed surrounding that point.
These waves look like concentric circles and they are known aswavefronts.
The wavefronts gradually spread in all the directions.
When the locus of all the waves is joined which are in the same phase, it will be the same as a sphere, and are known as Primary wavefront.
Secondary wavefront are formed fromeach point on the Primary wavefront.
The common tangential line that envelopes these secondary wavefronts will further give rise to other secondarywavefronts.
All wavefronts will gradually fade after some time.
Conclusion: - According to Huygens principle, every point on a wavefront give rise to secondary wavelets which spread out in all the directions with the speed of a wave.
Application------------------
Property------------------
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
Using Huygens principle we can determine the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Mathematically: To calculate the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Let the initial time ti =0.
Each wave will travel =vt1where v=speed of the wave.
Distance travelled by each wave is equal to the radius of the sphere.
Therefore radius of sphere = v t1.
Common tangent joining all the spheres will give the position of the new wavefront at time t=t1.
There are 2 possibilities: - outer tangent and inner tangent.
The amplitude of the back wave is 0. Therefore the back wave is neglected and the forward wave was considered.
New wave front will arise from each point on the outer wavefront.
Therefore the distance covered by these wavefronts = vt2.
And again spheres will be obtained and by drawing common tangent will tell the position of all the new wavefront after time t2.
Again back wave is neglected and forward wavefront is considered.
This shows the wavefront keep on spreading with time.

To prove Snell’s law:-
Consider two triangle’s ABC and AEC :-
In triangle ABC sin i= (BC/AC) and sin r=(AE/AC)
 By dividing (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AC) x (AC/AE)
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AE) =(v1τ) /(v2τ)
=> (sin i/sin r) =τ.
Refractive index n; =(c/V) 
Where c = velocity of light in vacuum and V=velocity of light in medium.
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (c/n1)/(c/n2)
Where n1 and n2 are the refractive index in medium 1 and 2 resp.
Snell’s law (sin i/sin r) = (n1/ n2). Hence proved.
Angle of incidence is less than angle of refraction, i<r.
=> v1< v2.

Concave mirror:-
The concave mirror converges the incident wavefront at the focus which is at the same side.
Effects ofPrism,convex lens and concave mirrorcan be explained in terms of wave front.
According to Huygens velocity of the light in the denser medium is lesser than the velocity in the rarer medium.
In a prism or convex lens, velocity of wavefront inside them is lesser than the velocity outside.
Consider the fig the wave (1) will travel a very little portion of the denser medium whereas wave (2) will travel more portion of the rarer medium.
This means the velocity of wave (2) is less for longer period of time because of which they take more time to come out of the prism.
Wave (1) travel with lesser speed for small amount of time. So they reach faster.
In case of convex lens the waves which are in middle will travel maximum portion of the denser medium. Therefore they travel more time in the denser medium.
They have less velocity as a result they will take more time as compared to the waves at the edges.
As the lens is thinner at both the edges.

Definition------------------
Doppler’s effect

Doppler Effect is the shift in frequency of light when there is relative motion between the source and observer.
It is used to measure the speed of a receding object.
When the source is moving away from the observer then the wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer.
When a star is moving away from the earth the wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum.
As a result star looks more reddish when moves away from the earth.
This is known as red shift phenomenon.
When the waves are received from a sourcemoving towards the observer, there is an apparent decrease in wavelength. This is called blue shift.
The fractional change in frequency (Δν/ν)=(–vradial/c),
Where vradial= component of the source velocity along the line joining the
observer to the source; vradial is considered positive when the source moves away from the observer.
Thus, the Doppler shift can be expressed as:
(Δν/ν) = (–vradial/c);
It is valid when the speed of the source is small compared to that of light.

Young’s double slit experiment (YDSE)

The Young’s experiment shows that matter and energy can display both wave and particle characteristics.

Purpose of double slit experiment is as follows:-

In order to prove the wave nature of light.
To explain the phenomenon of interference.
Two coherent sources of light were taken in order to maintain the 0 or constant phase difference between the sources of light.

Experimental set-up1:-
Young took an ordinary source of light(S) such as light bulb.
The light was made to pass through a very small slit S (which was comparable with the wavelength of light).
The light coming from Source S was made to pass through two small slits S1 and S2 which were separated by a very small distance d.
One screen was kept in front of these 2 sources.
Observation1:-

He observed alternate dark and light bands were formed on the screen.
Setup 2:-

Now he took 2 light bulbs i.e. 2 non coherent sources of light and placed a screen in front of them.
Observation 2:-

He observed there were no alternate bands of light formed on the screen.
Conclusion:-
When coherent sources of light were taken then the phenomenon of interference is taking place.
When non-coherent sources were taken phenomenon of interference was not taking place.
The source S illuminated the sources S1 and S2 as a result the light from S1 and S2 become coherent.
S was the source of bothS1 and S2, therefore if there is any change in the phase of the source there will be change in the both sources also.
Therefore both S1 and S2 will be always in phase with each other.
Conclusion of Young’s double slit experiment

Central fringes gets shifted by – θ if the source gets shifted by θ.
If the source S is shifted by some angle θ, there will be no change in fringe pattern. The central fringe will get shifted in the opposite direction.
Intensity of the fringes increase if point sources are replaced with slits.
If there are slits instead of point source then more light waves will be able to pass through the slits.
As a result stronger wavefronts are formedwhich give rise to even greater intensity fringes.

Resolving Power of Optical instruments

Resolving power is defined as the inverse of the distance between two objects which can be just resolved when viewed through the optical instrument.
Optical instruments should be able to display two separate images as distinct two separate images.
Suppose if we are seeing 2 stars in the sky using telescope, and they are very closely placed to each other, they should not be displaced as one star.
Instead they should be displaced as two separate stars. The ability to see them as separate 2 stars is known as resolving power.
For example: -
Consider 2 rooms one is lit and another is dark.The room which is lit we are able to see everything clearly whereas in second room we are not able to see properly.
This is because the resolving power with which we are viewing second room is not good.
If the resolving power is better the image will be clearer.So everything can be seen clearly.

Diffraction in resolving power of telescope

In telescope resolving power plays an important role.
In telescope there are 2 lenses one is objective lens and other is eye-piece.
The purpose of objective lens to create an image at the second focal length of the objective and the first focal length of eyepiece.
The image which iscreated will be inverted and diminished.
The purpose of eye-piece is just to enlarge the image formed by the objective lens at the focal length.
The purpose of objective lens is to resolve images as distinct.
For example: -
If we are viewing 2 different stars the purpose of objective lens will be to resolve the stars as 2 distinct stars.
Whenever a ray of light passes through the objective lens it should get focus at a particular point.
But because of the phenomenon of diffraction instead of focussing at a specific point the image gets focussed in and around that area.
Limit of Resolution :
Limit of resolution is defined as the angle subtended by the distant objects on the objective.
This means how small an object can be resolved by the telescope.
It is denoted by dθ.
Case 1:-The limit of resolution is 0.2 radians.
That is telescope can resolve up to 0.2 radians.
Case2:- The limit of resolution is 20 radians.
The telescope can resolve up to 20 radians.
Lesser the limit of resolution better is the resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝ (1/dθ).
dθ∝ (λ/D)
=>Limit of resolutiondθ =(1.22 λ/D)
Whereλ =wavelength of the wave, D =diameter of the objective lens.
If the diameter of the objective lens is large then more and more light can pass through it.
As a result telescope will be able to give more detailed image.
Resolving Power:
Resolving power is defined as the relationship between limit of resolution and resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝(1/dθ).
dθ ∝ (λ/D)
Where diameter of the aperture of the convex lens D = (2a) and f=focal length of the lens.
When a parallel beam of light is incident on the convex lens it should get focussed at one single point.
But diffraction occurs when the distance measured is comparable to the wavelength of the light.
Therefore instead of single point a spotappears. This spot appears because of diffraction.
There will be one central maximum surrounded by dark band (minima) then secondary maxima and then secondary minima.
Experimentally the radius of Central maxima= (1.22λ/D).
P of a telescope ∝(D/1.22λ).
Conclusion:-A telescope must have a larger diameter objective for better resolution.

Diffraction in resolving power of Microscope

In case of microscope resolving power helps to magnify the image.
Resolution helps to distinguish between the small similar particles of an object when they are so closely placed with each other.
When the distance between 2 points is comparable to the wavelength then diffraction occurs.
Image formed due to the diffraction pattern vθ = v (22λ/D).
The minimum distance for the object to be resolved is v (22 λ)/(D)andbeyond this point the object cannot be resolved.
Minimum separation between objects to get resolved is given as:-
dmin = (v (1.22λ/D))/m  
Where m =magnification.
dmin= (1.22λ/D) f;
Where f=focal length.
tanβ = (D/2f)
Whereβ = angle made by the objective lens at its focus, D=diameter and f=focus.
tanβ = 1.22f λ
Therefore dmin = (1.22λ)/(tanβ)
dmin= (1.22λ)/(2tanβ) if β≈ small, tanβ≈ sinβ≈β
dmin= (1.22 λ)/(2 sin β)
Suppose if the medium between the object and the objective lens has refractive index n.
dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) where n sinβ = numerical aperture of objective lens.
Therefore dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) is known as numerical aperture of the objective lens.
Resolving Power(R.P) of a microscope ∝ (1/dmin).
This implies resolving power decreases as the distance increases.
=>P. =(2n sin β)/(1.22 λ)
Conclusion:-Resolving power can be increased by choosing medium of higher refractive index.

Nature of Electromagnetic Waves

Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an electromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and B are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency ν, wavelength λ, propagating along z-direction, we have
Speed of Electromagnetic Wave

The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to μ and ε (the free space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:

human eye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
The minimum distance at which the particular object can be seen clearly is known as least distance of distinct vision. This is also called Near Point of the Eye. For young individuals, near point is about 25 cm. The farthest point to which an object can be seen is known as Far Point of the Eye. This is about 25 cm to infinity.
Presbyopia is defined as the one in which power of accommodation decreases with ageing. They have difficulty in near vision. Ciliary muscles get weakened and the flexibility of the eye lens gets diminished. Generally, bifocal lens are used for correcting the defects.
Power of accommodation. The ability of an eye to focus the distant objects as well as nearby objects on the retina clearly by changing the focal length of lens is called power of accommodation. A normal eye has a power of accommodation which enables the objects as far as infinity and as close as 25 cm to be focused on retina.
Eye lens. An eye lens is composed of fibrous jelly like material. Its focal length can be changed by ciliary muscles by pressing or stretching it. To increase the focal length, the ciliary muscles are in the relaxed position and the lens is thin.
Near point or least distance of distinct vision. The minimum distance at which an object placed can be seen clearly without strain is called near point or least distance of distinct vision. For a healthy human eye, near point is 25 cm.
Far point The farthest point up to which the eye can see the object clearly is called the far point of the eye. The far point for a healthy human eye is at infinity.
Cataract The condition in which the lens of the eye of a person becomes cloudy and milky resulting in blurred vision is called cataract.
Accommodation: The ability of the eye to focus both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal length, is called the accommodation of the eye or the ability of the ciliary muscles to change the focal length of the eye lens is called accommodation.
The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision. For a young adult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.
When a person cannot distinguish between different colours, he is said to be colour blind though his vision may otherwise be normal. Colour blindness is a genetic disorder which occurs by inheritance. So far, there is no cure for colour blindness.
. Farpoint: The farthest point upto which a short sighted eye can see clearly is called the far point of the eye. For a normal eye, the far point is infinity.
Near point : The nearest point upto which a long sighted eye can see clearly is called the near point of the eye. For a normal human eye, of an adult, the near point is about 25 cm from the eye.
Least cfistance of distinct vision: The minimum distance upto which an eye can see clearly is called the legist distance of distinct vision ; it is normally denoted by D. The least distance of distinct vision is equal to the distance between the eye and its near point. For a normal human eye, this distance is around 25 cm
The distance between far point and near point of the eye is called range of vision of the eye.
 The most familiar form of electromagnetic radiation may be defined as that part of the spectrum that the human eye can detect. Light is produced by the rearrangement of electrons in atoms and molecules. The various wavelengths of visible light are classified with colours ranging from violet (λ = 4 x 10-7 m) to red (λ = 7 x 10-7 m). The eye’s sensitivity is a function of wavelength, the sensitivity being a maximum at a wavelength of about λ = 5.6 x 10-7 m (yellow-green).
Persistence of Vision : It is the time for which the sensation of an object continue in the eye. It is about 1/16th of a second.
Cataract : The image can not be seen distinctly because eye lens become milky and cloudy. This condition is known as cataract, it can cause complete or partial loss of vision.
This can be corrected by surgical removal of extra growth (cataract surgery).

In old age people, the lens becomes milky and cloudy, this is known as Cataract. This can leads to complete or partial loss of vision.
Working of eye The light falling on the eye gets refracted through the cornea. This amount of light is controlled by the pupil. The eye lens converges the light rays and forms an image on the retina. The focal length of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles. Retina converts the light rays into electrical signals which are sent by optic nerves to the brain. The brain interprets these signals and we see the objects as it is.
Eye lens. An eye lens is composed of fibrous jelly like material. Its focal length can be changed by ciliary muscles by pressing or stretching it. To increase the focal length, the ciliary muscles are in the relaxed position and the lens is thin.
Cause of formation of cataract Cataract develops when the eye lens of a person becomes cloudy due to the formation of a membrane of proteins over it.
The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm.
Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus.
 In the eye, the image is formed on the retina by successive refractions at the cornea, the aqueous humour, the lens and the vitreous humour. Electrical signals then travel along the optic nerve to the brain to be interpreted. In good light, the yellow spot is most sensitive to detail and the image is automatically formed there.
Defects of the Eye : Although the eye is one of the most remarkable organs in the body, it may have several abnormalities, which can often be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery. The various defects from which an eye can suffer are (i) Hypermetropia or long sightedness, (ii) Myopia or shortsightedness and (iii) Astigmatism, (iv) Presbyopia.
When a person suffers from both, the myopia as well as Hypermetropia, his spectacles for correction have bifocal lenses. The upper half is a concave lens for distant vision and lower half is a convex lens for reading.
As our two eyes are separated by a few centimetres, each eye observes a slightly different image. Our brain combines the two views into one and we get to know how close or far away the things seen are.
Persistence of vision of the eye: The image of an object persists on the retina for 1/16 second, even after the removal of the object. The sequence of still pictures taken by a movie camera is projected on a screen at a rate of about 24 images or more per second. The successive impressions of images on the screen appear to merge smoothly into one another to give us the feeling of moving images.
When a person cannot distinguish between different colours, he is said to be colour blind though his vision may otherwise be normal. Colour blindness is a genetic disorder which occurs by inheritance. So far, there is no cure for colour blindness.

Human Eye:
a)   It is the most familiar and complicated optical instrument provided by nature to living beings. In this device, light enters through a curved front surface, called cornea, passes through the pupil – central hole in the iris.
b)  The light is focused by the eye lens on the retina.
c)  The retina senses light intensity and colour and transmits the electrical signals via optical nerves to the brain.
d)  Brain finally processes the information.
Accomodation of human eye: It is the ability of the eye lens due to which it can change its focal length so that images of objects at various distances can be formed on the same retina.
When a person suffers from both, the myopia as well as Hypermetropia, his spectacles for correction have bifocal lenses. The upper half is a concave lens for distant vision and lower half is a convex lens for reading.
As our two eyes are separated by a few centimetres, each eye observes a slightly different image. Our brain combines the two views into one and we get to know how close or far away the things seen are.
 By donating our eyes after we die, one pair of our eyes can give vision to two corneal blind people. Eye donors may belong to any sex or any age group. People suffering from diabetes, hypertension, asthma or any other non- communicable diseases can donate eyes. People who have been using spectacles or those operated for cataract can also donate eyes.

The successive impressions of images on the screen appear to merge smoothly into one another to give us the feeling of moving images.
The Reason of defect
Excessive curvature of eye lens means Eye lens be comes thick and its focal length decreases.

force!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
A force is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object’s interaction with another object.
Balanced forces: Forces are said to be balanced forces if they nullify one another and their resultant force is zero
Unbalanced forces: When two opposite forces acting on a body, move a body in the direction of the greater force or forces which brings motion in a body are called as unbalanced forces.
1 Newton: A force of one Newton produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 on an object of mass 1 kg.
 Balanced Forces:  If the resultant of applied forces is equal to zero, it is called balanced forces.
Unbalanced Forces:  If the resultant of applied forces are greater than zero, the forces are called unbalanced forces.
Muscular Force: The force exerted by the human body muscles is called muscular force.
What is a force? Whenever we push or pull an object a force acts upon them and makes them move from one place to another. Hence, force can initiate motion in a motionless object, change (increase or decrease) the velocity of the moving object, alter the direction of a moving object, change the shape and size of an object.
Balanced Forces - When equal amount of forces are applied on an object from different directions such that they cancel out each other. They do not change the state of rest or motion of an object. They may change the shape and size of an object.
Unbalanced Force – When forces applied to an object are of different magnitude(or not in opposite directions so as to cancel). They can alter state of rest or motion of an object. They can cause acceleration in an object. They can change the shape and size of an object
Balanced Forces. If the resultant of applied forces is equal to zero, it is called balanced forces.
Unbalanced Forces.If the resultant of applied forces are greater than zero the forces are called unbalanced forces. An object in rest can be moved because of applying balanced forces.
A push or a pull on an object is called a Force. Push refers to the force which tends to 'move the object away'  from the direction of the force applied. Pull refers to that force which tends to 'move the object towards'  the direction of the force applied. 
Examples of Push :
(i) Pushing a door open                 (ii) Man pushing his luggage trolley     (iii) Man hitting a golf ball
Examples of Pull:
(i)Opening the drawers                    (ii) Child pulling a wagon                            (iii) Crane pulling up an object 
Contact forces : Force that arises with the contact of 2 or more objects involved. Examples : Muscular force and Frictional Force


Muscular force is the type of force wherein we use our physical strength to change the state of motion of an object. Eg: Man pushing a car, Bullocks pulling a cart of load, Cycling, Weight Lifting
Frictional Force is a force that acts on all moving objects by the surface which it is in contact with. Eg: A ball rolling on the ground encounters friction by the ground surface and it eventually comes to a halt. When the rowing of the boat has stopped, the boat comes to a stop because of the frictional force exerted by water on it. The Frictional force is always in the direction opposite to the applied force.
Non-contact forces: Forces that arise without the contact of 2 or more objects involved. Examples: Magnetic Force, Electrostatic Force, Gravitational force.


Force acting on unit area is called Pressure ie Pressure =   Force/Area

This explains why it is easier to hammer a nail into the wall. It is because we apply a greater amount of force into a very small area of the screw head. Going by the above equation, the force is large and the area is small. So, the pressure is very high.  There are instances when you also can feel pressure - when you are having a body massage. When a person massages your body with his hands, the force applied is very high on a relatively small area of his hand. The pressure is high and there is bearable but curative pain and pressure that you feel.
A pull or push over an object is called force.
Force – A push or a pull upon  an object resulting from its interaction with another object  is called  force.
Pressure – The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.
Pressure = Force / Area.  ( lesser the area, greater is the pressure.)
Types------------------
Contact forces : Force that arises with the contact of 2 or more objects involved. Examples : Muscular force and Frictional Force


Non-contact forces: Forces that arise without the contact of 2 or more objects involved. Examples: Magnetic Force, Electrostatic Force, Gravitational force.


Effects------------------
A force can do three things on a body. It can change the speed of a body. It can change the direction of motion of a body. It can change the shape of a body.
Balanced forces do not cause any change of state of an object. Balanced forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Balanced forces can change the shape and size of an object. For example: When we press a balloon from opposite sides, the size and shape of balloon is changed.
Unbalanced forces can change the speed and position of an object, Change the shape and size of an object.
What is a force? Whenever we push or pull an object a force acts upon them and makes them move from one place to another. Hence, force can initiate motion in a motionless object, change (increase or decrease) the velocity of the moving object, alter the direction of a moving object, change the shape and size of an object.
Unbalanced Force – When forces applied to an object are of different magnitude(or not in opposite directions so as to cancel). They can alter state of rest or motion of an object. They can cause acceleration in an object. They can change the shape and size of an object
Force can make a stationary body in motion. For example a football can be set to move by kicking it, i.e. by applying a force.
Force can stop a moving body: For example by applying brakes, a running cycle or a running vehicle can be stopped.
Force can change the direction of a moving object. For example; By applying force, i.e. by moving handle the direction of a running bicycle can be changed. Similarly by moving steering the direction of a running vehicle is changed.
Force can change the speed of a moving body: By accelerating, the speed of a running vehicle can be increased or by applying brakes the speed of a running vehicle can be decreased.
Force can change the shape and size of an object. For example: By hammering, a block of metal can be turned into a thin sheet. By hammering a stone can be broken into pieces.
Balanced forces do not cause any change of state of an object. Balanced forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Unbalanced forces can do the following: Move a stationary object. Increase the speed of a moving object. Decrease the speed of a moving object. Stop a moving object. Change the shape and size of an object.
From the above figures, we can understand the following characteristics of Force

Force has both magnitude and direction.
Case (i) Magnitude of forces : F1,F2, Direction of forces: Left to Right (--->)
Case(ii) Magnitude of forces applied: F1,F2.
Direction of force F1 is Left to Right (--->). 
Direction of Force F2 is Right to Left (<---)
More than one force can be applied on an object.
Forces applied in the same direction add up to each other.
If forces are applied in the same direction, the total force adds up in the same direction. In case(i), forces are applied in the same direction. So the total force applied on the 'Heavy Object' is F1+F2 towards Right (--->)
If forces are applied in the opposite direction, then the net force acting on the object is the difference between the forces and the object tends to move in the direction of the greater force.
In case(ii),If F1=F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2=0. The object does not move in any direction.
If F1>F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2. The object moves in the direction of F1 ie towards Right (--->)
If F2>F1, the net force on the object is F = F2-F1. The object moves in the direction of F2 ie towards Left(<---)
If the magnitude or direction of the force changes, its effect also changes.
Force can change the shape of an object in some cases.

When making rotis from kneaded dough.
When force is applied on the lead of a pencil, it breaks.
When a elastic is pulled hard, it expands and loses its elasticity.


From the discussion above, we can summarize  that Force can have any or all of the following effects on the object on which it is applied.

Force can change the speed of an object (Batsman hitting a ball very hard)
Force can change the direction of motion of an object (Batsman hitting a ball very hard)
Force can change the shape of an object. (When an elastic is pulled hard, it breaks)
Force can move an object from rest to a state of motion (Bowler picking up a ball and then bowling it)
Examples------------------
Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary for the practice to counter the opposing force of friction.
For example: In the tug of war game when the force applied by both teams is equal in magnitude then the rope does not move in either side. This is due to the balanced forces in which resultant of applied forces comes out to be zero.
Force can make a stationary body in motion. For example a football can be set to move by kicking it, i.e. by applying a force.
Force can stop a moving body: For example by applying brakes, a running cycle or a running vehicle can be stopped.
Force can change the direction of a moving object. For example; By applying force, i.e. by moving handle the direction of a running bicycle can be changed. Similarly by moving steering the direction of a running vehicle is changed.
Force can change the speed of a moving body: By accelerating, the speed of a running vehicle can be increased or by applying brakes the speed of a running vehicle can be decreased.
Force can change the shape and size of an object. For example: By hammering, a block of metal can be turned into a thin sheet. By hammering a stone can be broken into pieces.
Example: In the tug of war if both the teams apply similar magnitude of forces in oppoisite directions, rope does not move in either side. This happens becasue of balanced forces in which resultant of applied forces become zero.
In our daily life, we apply force on many objects, due to which the objects change their position or shape. Eg : When a football is kicked, it moves. When we throw a smash a fully inflated balloon in between our palms, it breaks. When a cricket fielder catches the ball, it stops. A man cycling. In this chapter, we will study about force and its characteristics.
A push or a pull on an object is called a Force. Push refers to the force which tends to 'move the object away'  from the direction of the force applied. Pull refers to that force which tends to 'move the object towards'  the direction of the force applied. 
Examples of Push :
(i) Pushing a door open                 (ii) Man pushing his luggage trolley     (iii) Man hitting a golf ball
Examples of Pull:
(i)Opening the drawers                    (ii) Child pulling a wagon                            (iii) Crane pulling up an object 
As we can see in all of the above cases, 2 or more objects must interact for force to come into play. Eg 1: In the case of man pulling his luggage trolley, there is an interaction between the man and his trolley. The man is applying a 'push' on his trolley to make it move forward. Eg 2: In the case of the crane pulling the object, there is an interaction between the crane and the object. The crane is applying force of the object to pull it up.
A change in either speed of an object or direction of an object or both is described as a change in its state of motion. Force can change the state of motion of an object.

Let's consider the following sequence of events

A cricket ball is initially at rest.
The bowler picks it up and bowls it towards the batsman.
The batsman hits it with the bat. Subsequently, any of the following events could happen
The batsman hit the ball very hard such that it goes for flying in the air for a six.
The batsman hits the ball such that it goes for a four along the ground.
The batsman hits the ball and the bowler catches it.
The batsman hits a defense shot such that it rolls on the ground for a short distance and stops.
Now from (1) to (2), the ball has changed its speed. Initially, the speed for 0 m/s (at rest) and then the bowler flings it. So, now it moves with a certain speed. When the batsman hits the ball, according to the force applied on the ball, the direction or speed or both change. Any one of the events (a),(b),(c),(d) occurs. When the strike is very hard and upwards, it goes for a six(3a). When the strike is reasonably hard and along the ground, it goes for a four (3b). When the bowler catches it (3c), the bowler has applied has applied a force on it to stop it. When the force of the batsman is very weak, the ball rolls on the ground and eventually stops.
Force can change the shape of an object in some cases.

Eg: A ball rolling on the ground encounters friction by the ground surface and it eventually comes to a halt. When the rowing of the boat has stopped, the boat comes to a stop because of the frictional force exerted by water on it. The Frictional force is always in the direction opposite to the applied force.
Non-contact forces: Forces that arise without the contact of 2 or more objects involved. Examples: Magnetic Force, Electrostatic Force, Gravitational force.


Example – to open a drawer, one has to pull it; and to close the drawer one has to push it. Thus, in both the conditions a person applies force by pull or push.
Application------------------
Pressure – The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.
Pressure = Force / Area.  ( lesser the area, greater is the pressure.)
Property------------------
What is a force? Whenever we push or pull an object a force acts upon them and makes them move from one place to another. Hence, force can initiate motion in a motionless object, change (increase or decrease) the velocity of the moving object, alter the direction of a moving object, change the shape and size of an object.
Balanced Forces - When equal amount of forces are applied on an object from different directions such that they cancel out each other. They do not change the state of rest or motion of an object. They may change the shape and size of an object.
Unbalanced Force – When forces applied to an object are of different magnitude(or not in opposite directions so as to cancel). They can alter state of rest or motion of an object. They can cause acceleration in an object. They can change the shape and size of an object
From the above figures, we can understand the following characteristics of Force

Force has both magnitude and direction.
Case (i) Magnitude of forces : F1,F2, Direction of forces: Left to Right (--->)
Case(ii) Magnitude of forces applied: F1,F2.
Direction of force F1 is Left to Right (--->). 
Direction of Force F2 is Right to Left (<---)
More than one force can be applied on an object.
Forces applied in the same direction add up to each other.
If forces are applied in the same direction, the total force adds up in the same direction. In case(i), forces are applied in the same direction. So the total force applied on the 'Heavy Object' is F1+F2 towards Right (--->)
If forces are applied in the opposite direction, then the net force acting on the object is the difference between the forces and the object tends to move in the direction of the greater force.
In case(ii),If F1=F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2=0. The object does not move in any direction.
If F1>F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2. The object moves in the direction of F1 ie towards Right (--->)
If F2>F1, the net force on the object is F = F2-F1. The object moves in the direction of F2 ie towards Left(<---)
If the magnitude or direction of the force changes, its effect also changes.
A change in either speed of an object or direction of an object or both is described as a change in its state of motion. Force can change the state of motion of an object.

The Frictional force is always in the direction opposite to the applied force.
To apply a force over an object interaction between object and source of force is necessary.
Causes------------------
Unbalanced forces: When two opposite forces acting on a body, move a body in the direction of the greater force or forces which brings motion in a body are called as unbalanced forces.
To move an object unbalanced forces are to be applied from the opposite directions. In case of unbalanced forces acting on a body, it moves a in the direction of the greater force.

To ride a bicycle one has to push the pedal. In this condition, force is applied while pushing the pedal.
Forces are due an interaction:
Reasoning------------------
Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary for the practice to counter the opposing force of friction.
Example: In the tug of war if both the teams apply similar magnitude of forces in oppoisite directions, rope does not move in either side. This happens becasue of balanced forces in which resultant of applied forces become zero.
Formulae------------------
Force acting on unit area is called Pressure ie Pressure =   Force/Area

This explains why it is easier to hammer a nail into the wall. It is because we apply a greater amount of force into a very small area of the screw head. Going by the above equation, the force is large and the area is small. So, the pressure is very high.  There are instances when you also can feel pressure - when you are having a body massage. When a person massages your body with his hands, the force applied is very high on a relatively small area of his hand. The pressure is high and there is bearable but curative pain and pressure that you feel.
Pressure – The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.
Pressure = Force / Area.  ( lesser the area, greater is the pressure.)

momentum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :p = mv
Momentum: The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity. Its S.I. unit is kg m/s.
Momentum: The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. Thus, momentum = mass × velocity Or, p = m x v  where, p = momentum m = mass of the body v = velocity of the body . The Sl unit of momentum is kilograms meters per second (kg.m/s)
Rate of change of momentum: The rate at which the momentum of an object is changing is known as rate of change of momentum.
Momentum – The product of mass and velocity is called Momentum. It is a vector quantity. Its direction is same as that of the object’s velocity. Denoted by – p. SI unit – kg metre per second. p = mv, where m is the mass of the object, v is the velocity of the object.
MOMENTUM Momentum is the power of motion of an object. The product of velocity and mass is called the momentum. Momentum is denoted by ‘p’. Therefore, momentum of the object = Mass x Velocity. Or, p = m x v Where, p = momentum, m = mass of the object and v = velocity of the object.
Since, momentum is the product of mass and velocity (p = m x v) of an object. This means momentum is directly proportional to mass and velocity.Momentum increases with increase of either mass or velocity of an object.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
Applications of Momentum: A small bullet can penetrate into the body of a man and kill him when fired from a gun because it has a large momentum due to its great velocity. A person gets severely injured when hit by a fast moving vehicle which is due to the momentum of vehicle due to large mass and high velocity.
Examples------------------
Applications of Momentum: A small bullet can penetrate into the body of a man and kill him when fired from a gun because it has a large momentum due to its great velocity. A person gets severely injured when hit by a fast moving vehicle which is due to the momentum of vehicle due to large mass and high velocity.
The impact produced by a moving object depends upon its mass and velocity.For Example, a small bullet fired at a high velocity can kill a person.
A person gets injured in the case of getting hit by a moving object, such as stone, pebbles or anything because of momentum of the object.
Even a small bullet is able to kill a person when it is fired from a gun becasue of its momentum due to great velocity.
A person gets injured severely when hit by a moving vehicles, becasue of momentum of vehicle due to mass and velocity.
If a small object is moving with great velocity, it has tremendous momentum. And because of momentum, it can harm an object more severely. For example a small bullet having a little mass even kills a person when it is fired from a gun.
Usually, road accidents prove more fatal because of high speed than at slower speed. This happens because vehicles running with high speed have greater momentum compare to a vehicle running with slower speed.
Let an object with mass 'm' is in the rest. Since, object is in rest, therefore, it's velocity, v = 0. Now, we know that, Momentum = mass x velocity .Or, p = m x 0 = 0.Thus, the momentum of an object in the rest, i.e. non-moving,is equal to zero.

Reasoning------------------
The impact produced by a moving object depends upon its mass and velocity.For Example, a small bullet fired at a high velocity can kill a person.
The momentum of a stationary object – Let the mass of a stationary object be ‘m’, Let the velocity of a stationary object be ‘v’, The stationary object has no velocity, so v = 0, Therefore, p = m*v = m*0 = 0. So, the momentum of a stationary object is zero.
We know that the velocity of an object can be changed by applying an unbalanced force on to it. Similarly, the momentum of an object can change by applying an unbalanced force.
A person gets injured in the case of getting hit by a moving object, such as stone, pebbles or anything because of momentum of the object.
Even a small bullet is able to kill a person when it is fired from a gun becasue of its momentum due to great velocity.
A person gets injured severely when hit by a moving vehicles, becasue of momentum of vehicle due to mass and velocity.
Since, momentum is the product of mass and velocity (p = m x v) of an object. This means momentum is directly proportional to mass and velocity.Momentum increases with increase of either mass or velocity of an object.
This means if a lighter and a heavier object is moving with same velocity, then heavier object will have more momentum than lighter one.
If a small object is moving with great velocity, it has tremendous momentum. And because of momentum, it can harm an object more severely. For example a small bullet having a little mass even kills a person when it is fired from a gun.

inertia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
 The inherent property, with which a body resists any change in its state of motion is called inertia. Heavier the body, the inertia is more and lighter the body, lesser the inertia.
Law of inertia states that a body has the inability to change its state of rest or uniform motion (i.e., a motion with constant velocity) or direction of motion by itself.
Inertia: The natural tendency of an object to resist a change in their state of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.
The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its S.I. unit is kg. A body with greater mass has greater inertia.
Inertia is a property or tendency of every object to resist any change in its state of rest or of uniform Force and Laws of Motion. It is measured by mass of an object. The heavier the object, the greater will be its inertia.
Mass and Inertia:The property of an object because of which it resists to get disturbed its state is called Inertia. Inertia of an object is measured by its mass. Inertia is directly proportional to the mass. This means inertia increases with increase in mass and decreases with decrease in mass. A heavy object will have more inertia than lighter one.
In other words, the natural tendecny of an object that resists the change in state of motion or rest of the boject is called intertia.

reflection and refraction of light!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
When white light passes through a prism, the violet light bends most and the red light bends the least. Dispersion of light is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours on passing through a glass prism. The band of seven colours so obtained is called visible spectrum.
Distant star act like a point source of light. As the beam of starlight keeps deviating from its path, the apparent position of star keeps on changing because physical condition of earth’s atmosphere is not stationary
Hence the amount of light enters our eyes fluctuate some time bright and sometime faint.
This is the “Twinkling effect of star”.
Blue Sky
The blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of sunlight off the molecules of the atmosphere. This scattering, called Rayleigh scattering, is more effective at short wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). Therefore the light scattered down to the earth at a large angle with respect to the direction of the sun’s light is predominantly in the blue end of the spectrum.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
Examples------------------
Application------------------
Property------------------
The light rays emitted from the sun appear white but consists of 7 colours namely, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. There are various phenomena and objects that can split these white rays into individual colour rays.
The white light, or visible spectrum, is composed of seven colours. These colours are VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red). When white light passes through a prism, it breaks down into its component colours. This is the reason rainbows show all the colours of the visible spectrum
When white light passes through a prism, the violet light bends most and the red light bends the least. Dispersion of light is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours on passing through a glass prism. The band of seven colours so obtained is called visible spectrum.
The speed of light in vacuum is same for all wavelengths, but the speed in a material substance is different for different wavelengths.
Causes------------------
Cause of dispersion : Every colour has its own characteristic wavelength/frequency. Different colours move with same speed in air/vacuum. But their speeds in refracting media like glass are different. Therefore, refractive index of the medium for different colours is different. As a result, different colours undergo different deviations on passing through the prism. Hence, different colours emerge from the prism along different directions.
Atmospheric refraction is the cause of twinkling of stars, advance sunrise and delayed sunset.
Reasoning------------------
Cause of dispersion : Every colour has its own characteristic wavelength/frequency. Different colours move with same speed in air/vacuum. But their speeds in refracting media like glass are different. Therefore, refractive index of the medium for different colours is different. As a result, different colours undergo different deviations on passing through the prism. Hence, different colours emerge from the prism along different directions.
When we pass white light through two ideptical prisms held side by side with their refracting edges in opposite directions; the first prism disperses white light into seven colours and the second prism recombines the seven colours into white light. Thus, light emerging from 2nd prism is white.
Distant star act like a point source of light. As the beam of starlight keeps deviating from its path, the apparent position of star keeps on changing because physical condition of earth’s atmosphere is not stationary
Hence the amount of light enters our eyes fluctuate some time bright and sometime faint.
This is the “Twinkling effect of star”.
Blue Sky
The blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of sunlight off the molecules of the atmosphere. This scattering, called Rayleigh scattering, is more effective at short wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). Therefore the light scattered down to the earth at a large angle with respect to the direction of the sun’s light is predominantly in the blue end of the spectrum.

Heating        Effect:        The        wire        gets        hot        when        an        electric        current        passes        through        it.        This        is        the
heating        effect        of        the        electric        current.        Electric        heater        contains        a        coil        of        wire        called        element
which        becomes        red        hot        when        current        passes        through        it.        The        amount        of        heat        produced        in
a        wire        depends        on        its        material,        length        and        thickness.

This electric charge is carried by moving electrons(charge carriers) in a wire.
Electric current is measured as rate of flow of charge.
The SI unit for measuring an electric current is the Ampere (A).
Electric current is measured using a device called an Ammeter.
If the circuit is incomplete or broken, the current doesn’t flow. This type of circuit is called an Open Circuit.
If the circuit is complete, the current flows. This type of circuit is called a Closed Circuit.
When an electric current passes through a wire the wire gets heated up. This is known as the heating effect of electric current.
The heat that is produced in the wire depends upon the following factors:

the material of the wire

the length of the wire

the thickness of the wire
The filament of a bulb is a coiled wire that gets hot when electricity is passed through it. This makes the filament glow and as a result, light is produced from the bulb.
Elements of Heating Appliances: A heating appliance has a highly coiled wire or a metallic rod. This is called the element of the heating appliance. The highly coiled structure increases the surface area and thus provides more heat. The elements are usually made of constantan which is a metal with very high melting point.
Electric Current:
The flow of electrons in any material is termed as an electric current.
A device that can be used to produce an electric current is called a source of electric current. Common sources of electric current are cells and batteries (collection of cells) which comes in various shapes and sizes (Fig. 14.2), and electric current that we get from plug points in houses. A very useful kind of cell which we use very often is the dry cell. Due to a chemical reaction that takes place in cells and batteries, electric current is produced.

Heating elements have high melting point so that they do not get damaged due to the heat generated.
These elements have also low tendency to react with oxygen to avoid catching fire.
The heat that is produced in the wire depends upon the following factors:

the material of the wire

the length of the wire

the thickness of the wire
Depending upon the amount of heat required by such appliances different types, sizes and length of wire are used in them. Some virus can break down or melt as they get heated.
The filament of a bulb is a coiled wire that gets hot when electricity is passed through it. This makes the filament glow and as a result, light is produced from the bulb.
An electric room heater or an electric heater used for cooking contain a coil of wire.

This coil of wire is called an element when these appliances are switched on requirements, become red hot and give out heat.

Due to the heating effect of current, the filament of the bulb of the tester gets heated to a high temperature and it starts glowing.
If the current through a circuit is too weak, the filament does not get heated sufficiently and it does not glow.
Things that run on electricity have electric current passing through them. In this, chapter, you will learn about electric current, what is needed to produce it, the conditions required to make an electric current flow, and the materials through which current can flow. You will learn some very interesting things like how to make a small bulb glow and how to make an electric switch
Most of the devices and machines we use like an electric iron, oven, room heater, refrigerator, ceiling fan or an electric bulb work when an electric current flows through them.

With help from an adult, look at what is inside a transparent electric bulb (Fig. 14.1). Among other things, you will see that it has a thin filament (a very thin metal wire). The filament heats up when an electric current is passed through it. It heats up so much that it begins to glow and give out light.

MCB:        Stands        for        Miniature        Circuit        Breakers.        These        are        switches        which        automatically        turn
A Fuse or a Circuit Breaker is a device which protects appliances from overcurrent or overload.
An MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) is a switching device which automatically turns off when current exceeds a safe limit.
The automatic shutting off is called tripping or trip.
An electric fuse is a device that is used to prevent the damage that can be caused by an excess of electric current. According to the heating effect of the electric current, a wire becomes hot as current is passed through it. However, if an excess of current is passed through a wire it can melt or break.
Electric Fuse: Electric fuse is a safety device which is used in household wirings and in many appliances. Electric fuse has body made of ceramic and two points for attaching the fuse wire. The fuse wire melts whenever there is overload in the wiring. This breaks the circuit and helps in preventing damage to costly appliances and to the wiring. In electrical devices a glass fuse is often used. This is a small glass tube, in which lies the fuse wire.

Different types of fuses are used for different devices and some are also available for houses as well.

Property------------------
In the circuit, it is placed after the power source and before the appliance.
It has a wire of low resistance and low melting point.
In case of excessive current, the wire of the fuse melts resulting in breaking of the circuit. Thus, no current flows through the main appliance, protecting it from damage and possible fire.
Every Fuse is labeled with the maximum rating (current and voltage it can withstand before breaking).So, appropriate fuse should be used according to the appliance/circuit requirements.

According to the heating effect of the electric current, a wire becomes hot as current is passed through it. However, if an excess of current is passed through a wire it can melt or break.
The electric fuse consists of a wire which is made up of a metal or an alloy which has a low melting point. As a result, the wire breaks down easily as high current passes through it. As the wire breaks the circuit of the fuse opens and hence no for the current passes through it.
Fuses are generally used in electrical appliances. the nichrome wire, a thin strand of steel wool are used for making electric fuses
In all buildings fuses are inserted in all electrical circuits.
There is a maximum limit on the current which can safely flow through a circuit.
 If by accident the current exceeds this safe limit, the wires may become overheated and may cause fire.
If a proper fuse is there in the circuit, it will blow off and break the circuit.
A fuse is thus a safety device which prevents damages to electrical circuits and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in electrical circuits is the direct touching of wires.
This may happen if the insulation on the wires has come off due to wear and tear. This may cause a short circuit.

MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breaker): MCBs have been replacing electric fuse from wirings at most of the places. The electric fuse has a big practical problem. Whenever the wire fuses, one needs to replace the wire to resume electric supply. More often than not, this proves to be a cumbersome task. Miniature circuit breakers break the circuit automatically. One just needs to switch it on to resume the electric supply. Many models of MCBs have a built in mechanism by which the electric supply is automatically resumed.

Electric Bell: Electric Bell is composed of two rods of cast iron. Coil is made around the iron rods. A metallic strip is placed parallel to the coils. The metallic strip is fitted with a hammer at one end. Another end of the strip is connected to the circuit. A gong is placed in a position so that it can be hit by the hammer. When current flows in the circuit, the cast iron rods become electromagnet and attract the metallic strip. The metallic hammer hits the gong because of that. Once the metallic strip is pulled towards the electromagnet, it gets disconnected from the point and there is a break in the circuit. A spring pulls the metallic strip back because no magnetism is left in the electromagnet. This cycle continues and the electric bell produces a ringing sound.

An electric circuit can be drawn on a paper with the help of the symbols that are used for representing the electronic components. Such a representation of an electric circuit using its symbols is called an Electric Circuit Diagram.
Open Circuit - When the key is switched off or opened the circuit is said to be an open circuit as it is incomplete.
Electric Circuit: The path through which electric charge moves is called electric circuit.
Closed Circuit: When the circuit is complete, it is called closed circuit. Current flows only in a closed circuit.
Open Circuit: When the circuit is incomplete, it is called open circuit. Current does not flow in an open circuit.
When we connect the terminals of a pencil cell (name given to the cell due to its shape) to a bulb using two wires, the bulb glows. This happens because we provide a path for the current to flow. A path for an electric current to flow is called an electric circuit.
An electric switch is a device that is used to open or close an electric circuit. When we open an electric circuit, the flow of electric current in the circuit stops [Fig. 14.9(a)], and when we close an electric circuit, an electric current flows through it [Fig. 14.9(b)].

In Figure 14.6(a), one wire from the pencil cell is connected to the torch bulb, while the other wire is not. The electric circuit is not complete here. In Figure 14.6(b), both the wires from the cell are connected to the torch bulb. The electric circuit is complete in this case. Electric current flows only if there is an unbroken path or closed circuit starting from one terminal of the source, through the torch bulb, to the other terminal of the source. Thus, the bulb glows in Figure 14.6(b) but not in Figure 14.6(a). The circuit in Figure 14.6(a) is not complete. Hence, current cannot flow through the circuit and the bulb does not glow. Such a circuit is called an open circuit. The circuit in Figure 14.6(b) is complete. Electric current flows through the circuit and, as a result, the bulb glows. Such a circuit is called a closed circuit.
Electric current flows in a particular direction. In an electric circuit, the electric current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the electric cell. Figure 14.7 shows the direction of flow of electric current in a circuit.

A schematic diagram of an electric torch is shown in Fig. 14.10. An electric torch has one or more dry cells inside it, which act as the ‘source’. These cells are connected through a switch to a small bulb. When the switch is pushed to the ‘on’ position, the circuit is complete and the bulb glows. When the switch is pushed to the ‘off’ position, the circuit is incomplete (broken). Now the current cannot flow through the circuit, and the light goes out
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
The electric circuit shown here consists of a bulb. The bulb has a wire present inside it called the Filament. When the electric current passes through the filament it closed. The filament breaks when the bulb gets fused.
When the filament of a bulb breaks the circuit of the bulb becomes incomplete. Hence the bulb does not glow as it does not receive any electricity.

We describe the location of an object by specifying a reference point. Motion is relative. The total path covered by an object is said to be the distance travelled by it.
Uniform motion: When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion.
Non-uniform motion: Motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time.
When a body covers equal distance in equal interval of time, it is moving with uniform motion.
When a body covers unequal distance in equal interval of time. it is moving with non-uniform motion.
A freely falling object is any object moving freely under the influence of gravity alone.
It does not depend upon the initial motion of the object

acceleration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Acceleration: It is a measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time.
SI unit is ms-2.
It is a vector quantity; the acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity.
Acceleration: Change in the velocity of an object per unit time. a = v - u / t
Any change in velocity over a period of time is called acceleration.
The sign (+ or -) of indicates its direction. + sign shows the acceleration and – sign shows de-acceleration.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
When you apply brakes on a car the velocity is in forward direction but acceleration is in backward direction, so acceleration will be negative. It is also called deceleration.
When you are increasing the speed of a car the acceleration is positive as velocity and acceleration are in both in the forward direction
Examples------------------
Application------------------
Property------------------
Causes------------------
Acceleration can be caused either by change in direction of motion or change in speed or both.
When you are increasing the speed of a car the acceleration is positive as velocity and acceleration are in both in the forward direction
Reasoning------------------
Acceleration increases with increase in force and vice versa.Acceleration decreases with increase in mass and vice versa.That’s why a small vehicle requires less force to attain more acceleration while a heavy vehicle requires more force to get the same acceleration.
Formulae------------------
Acceleration: Change in the velocity of an object per unit time. a = v - u / t

Distance-Time Graph : In this graph, distance is taken along the y-axis and time is taken along the x–axis. For uniform speed, a graph of distance travelled against time is a straight line, as rate of change of change of distance with respect to time is constant.
Velocity-Time Graph : In this graph, velocity is taken along the y-axis and time is taken along the x–axis. For uniform acceleration, a graph of velocity against time is a straight line. The area enclosed by velocity-time graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement.
Position-Time Relation : A car having initial velocity u , is being subjected to a uniform acceleration a for a time period of t , after the time t the final velocity of the car is v. In the time interval of time t , it covers a distance of s. Now we need to derive relation between s,u,a,t graphically.

newton's laws of motion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Galileo Galilei Italian physicist and astronomer Formulated laws of motion for objects in free fall
There are three laws of Force and Laws of Motion those formed by Newton.
Galileo’s Observation - He observed the motion of objects on an inclined plane. When a marble is rolled down an inclined plane its velocity increases.
Galileo's Inference We need an unbalanced force to change the motion of the marble but no force is required when the marble is moving uniformly. In other words, objects move at a constant speed if no force acts upon them.
Based on Galileo’s ideas Newton presented the three Laws of Motion
Newton studied the ideas of Galileo and gave the three laws of motion. These laws are known as Newton’s Laws of Motion.

Galileo Galilei: Galileo first of all said that object move with a constant speed when no forces act on them. This means if an object is moving on a frictionless path and no other force is acting upon it, the object would be moving forever. That is there is no unbalanced force working on the object.
But practically it is not possible for any object. Because to attain the condition of zero unbalanced force is impossible. Force of friction, force air and many other forces always acting upon an object.

newton's first law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
First law of motion: An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.
Newton’s First Law of Force and Laws of Motion or Law of Inertia. It states that any object will remain in the state of rest or in uniform Force and Laws of Motion along a straight line, until it is compelled to change the state by applying external force.
First law of motion or The Law of Inertia Whether an object is moving uniformly on a straight path or is at rest, its state would not change until and unless an external force is applied on to it.
Hence, we can say that objects oppose a change in their state of motion or rest. This tendency of objects to remain in the state of rest or to keep moving uniformly is called Inertia.
Inertia and Mass.The inertia of an object is dependent upon its mass.Lighter objects have less inertia, that is, they can easily change their state of rest or motion.Heavier objects have large inertia and therefore they show more resistance.Hence ‘Mass’ is called a measure of the inertia of an object.
Newton's First Law of Motion: Any object remains in the state of rest or in uniform motion along a straight line, until it is compelled to change the state by applying external force.
Newton’s first law of motion states that “A body at rest or uniform motion will continue to be at rest or uniform motion until and unless a net external force acts on it”. Suppose a block is kept on the floor, it will remain at rest until we apply some external force to it. Also, we know that it takes us more effort or force to move a heavy mass. This is directly related to a property known as Inertia. This law is also known as the law of inertia.
The first law has already given us a qualitative definition of force. Now we are interested in finding out its magnitude. According to Newton’s second law of motion, the net force experienced by a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the body. It can be written as:

Application of Newton's first law of Force and Laws of Motion: When a straight moving bus suddenly stops down, the passengers sitting inside fall in forward  direction. This is because the body of the passenger initially moving in straight line tends to move the same way even after the brakes are applied , making the passenger fall in forward direction. When we hit a carpet it loses inertia of rest and moves. But the dust in it retains inertia of rest and is left behind. Thus dust and carpet are separated. When a tree is shaken, it moves to and fro. But fruit remains at rest due to its inertia of rest. Due to this fruit breaks off the tree.

Examples of Inertia. We fall back when a vehicle starts moving in the forward direction because our body is in the rest state and it opposes the motion of the vehicle. We fall forward when brakes are applied in a car because our body opposite the change of state of motion to rest
A person standing in a bus falls backward when bus is start moving suddenly. This happens because the person and bus both are in rest while bus is not moving, but as the bus starts moving the legs of the person start moving along with bus but rest portion of his body has tendency to remain in rest. Because of this person falls backward; if he is not alert.
A person standing in a moving bus falls forward if driver applies brakes suddenly. This happens because when bus is moving, the person standing in it is also in motion along with bus. But when driver applies brakes the speed of bus decreases suddenly or bus comes in the state of rest suddenly, in this condition the legs of the person which are in the contact with bus come in rest while the rest parts of his body have tendency to remain in motion. Because of this person falls forward if he is not alert.
Before hanging the wet clothes over laundry line, usually many jerks are given to the cloths to get them dried quickly. Because of jerks droplets of water from the pores of the cloth falls on the ground and reduced amount of water in clothes dried them quickly. This happens because, when suddenly cloth are made in motion by giving jerks, the water droplets in it have tendency to remain in rest and they are separated from cloths and fall on the ground.
When the pile of coin on the carom-board hit by a striker; coin only at the bottom moves away leaving rest of the pile of coin at same place. This happens because when the pile is struck with a striker, the coin at the bottom comes in motion while rest of the coin in the pile has tendency to remain in the rest and they vertically falls the carom board and remain at same place.
Seat belts are used in car and other vehicles, to prevent the passengers being thrown in the condition of sudden braking or other emergency. In the condition of sudden braking of the vehicles or any other emergency such as accident, the speed of vehicle would decrease or vehicle may stop suddenly, in that condition passengers may be thrown in the direction of the motion of vehicle because of the tendency to remain in the state of motion.
The head of hammer is tightened on a wooden handle by banging the handle against a hard surface. When handle of the hammer is struck against a surface, handle comes in rest while hammer over it's head has tendency to remain in motion and thus after some jerks it tightens over the handle.

Newton’s First Law of Motion: Explanation: If any object is in the state of rest, then it will remain in rest untill a exernal force is applied to change its state. Similarly an object will remain in motion untill any exeternal force is applied over it to change its state. This means all objects resist to in changing their state. The state of any object can be changed by applying external forces only.

Frictional Force: The force which opposes the Force and Laws of Motion of an object while being in contact with the other object, is known as frictional force.
What is the force of friction? It is a force extended when two surfaces are in contact with each other. It always acts in a direction opposite to the direction of motion of the object.
Frictional force (force of friction) – The force acting along the two surfaces in contact which opposes the motion of one body over the other is called the force of friction

newton's second law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force. Mathematically : F = k ma (where k is a proportionality constant). F = ma (∵ k = 1)
According to the second law of motion – The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the applied unbalanced force on the object in the direction of the force.
Newton's Second Law of Motion: The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force applied in the direction of force.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
force is directly proportional to acceleration. So the acceleration of an object can change depending upon the change in force applied.
Examples------------------
For Example – A cricketer when catches a ball pulls his hands in the backward direction to give some time to decrease the velocity of the ball. As the acceleration of the ball decreases the force exerted on catching the moving ball also decreases. If the cricketer would try to stop a moving ball suddenly he would have to apply larger force.
Newton's second Law of Motion states that The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force applied in the direction of force.
For example; when acceleration is applied on a moving vehicle, the momentum of the vehicle increases and the increase is in the direction of motion because the force is being applied in the direction of motion. On the other hand, when brake is applied on the moving vehicle, the momentum of the vehicle decreases and the decrease is in the opposite direction of motion because the force is being applied in the opposite direction of motion.
 A fielder pulls his hand backward; while catching a cricket ball coming with a great speed, to reduce the momentum of the ball with a little delay. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion; rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force applied in the direction.While catching a cricket ball the momentum of ball is reduced to zero when it is stopped after coming in the hands of fielder. If the ball is stopped suddenly, its momentum will be reduced to zero instantly. The rate of change in momentum is very quick and as a result, the player’s hand may get injured. Therefore, by pulling the hand backward a fielder gives more time to the change of momentum to become zero. This prevents the hands of fielder from getting hurt.
For athletes of long and high jump sand bed or cushioned bed is provided to allow a delayed change of momentum to zero because of jumping of athlete.When an athlete falls on the ground after performing a high or long jump, the momentum because of the velocity and mass of the athlete is reduced to zero. If the momentum of an athlete will be reduced to zero instantly, the force because of momentum may hurt the player. By providing a cushioned bed, the reduction of the momentum of the athlete to zero is delayed. This prevents the athlete from getting hurt.(c) Seat belts in car - Seat belts in the vehicles prevent the passenger from getting thrown in the direction of motion. In case of emergency, such as accidents or sudden braking, passengers may be thrown in the direction of motion of vehicle and may get fatal injuries. The stretchable seat belts increase the time of the rate of momentum to be reduced to zero. The delayed reduction of momentum to zero prevents passengers from such fatal injury.

Formulae------------------
Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force. Mathematically : F = k ma (where k is a proportionality constant). F = ma (∵ k = 1)
Let mass of an moving object = m. Let the velocity of the object changes from 
'u'; to 'v' in the interval of time 't'.This means, Initial velocity of the object = u. Final velocity of the object = v. We know that momentum (p) = Mass x velocityTherefore, Momentum (p) of the object at its initial velocity u = m × u = mu Momentum (p) of the object at its final velocity v = m × v = mv .The change in momentum = mv −mu Rate of change of momentum = mv − mu t -----(i
According to the Newton’s Second Law of motion force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum.This means, Force ∝ Rate of change of moentumAfter substituting the value of rate of change of momentum from equation (i) we get.Force (F)  ∝ mv − mu t⇒ F ∝ m(v − u) t ⇒ F ∝ mv − u t ⇒ F ∝ ma [∵ acceleration (a) = v − u t] [Since, acceleration is the rate of change in velocity] ⇒ F = k⋅m⋅a ----(ii) Where k is the proportionality constant ∵ 1 unit force is defined as the mass of 1kg object produces the acceleration of 1m/s2 ∴ 1 unit of force = k × 1 kg × 1m /s 2 ∴ by putting the value of  k =1 in equation (ii) F = m⋅a ----(iii)⇒ Force = mass x acceleration.Thus Newton’s Second Law of Motion gives the relation between force, mass and acceleration of an object.According to the relation obtained above, Newton’s Second Law can be modified as follows:The product of mass and acceleration is the force acting on the object.
The SI unit of Force: Newton (N). Since Force = Mass x AccelerationThe unit of mass = kg and The unit of acceleration = m/s2If force, mass and acceleration is taken as 1 unit.Therefore,1 Newton (N) = 1kg x 1m/s2. Thus, Newton (N) = kg m/s2 Equation (v) can be also written as ⇒ a = F m This equation is the form of Newton’s Second Law of Motion. According to this equation, Newton’s Second Law of Motion can also be stated as follow:The acceleration produced by a moving body is directly proportional to the force applied over it and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
f = kma. Where k is the constant of proportionality and it comes out to be 1 when the values are taken in SI unit. Hence the final expression will be,

newton's third law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.
Action and Reaction Forces. Two forces acting from opposite directions are called Action and Reaction Forces. For Example, a ball when hits the ground (action) bounces back with a certain force reaction.
The Third Law of Motion States that – When an object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantly exerts a force back onto the first object. These forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on two different objects always
every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
Conservation of Momentum As per the law of conservation of momentum, the sum of momenta of two objects before the collision and after collision remains the same given that no external unbalanced force acts upon them. In another way, collision conserves the total momentum of two objects.
Newton's Third Law of Motion: There is an equal and opposite reaction for every action.
Newton's Third Law of Motion Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that there is always reaction for every action in opposite direction and of equal magnitude.Explanation: Whenever a force is applied over a body, that body also applies same force of equal magnitude and in opposite direction.
Law of Conservation of Momentum: The sum of momenta of two objects remains same even after collision.In other words, the sum of momenta of two objects before collision and sum of momenta of two objects after collision are equal.
Above equation says that total momentum of object A and B before collision is equal to the total momentum of object A and B after collision. This means there is no loss of momentum, i.e. momentum is conserved. This situation is considered assuming there is no external force acting upon the object.This is the Law of Conservation of Momentum, which states that in a closed system the total momentum is constant.In the condition of collision, the velocity of the object which is moving faster is decreased and the velocity of the object which is moving slower is increased after collision. The magnitude of loss of momentum of faster object is equal to the magnitude of gain of momentum by slower object after collision.
According to Newton’s third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces are always found in pairs. For instance, when you sit on a chair, your body exerts a force downward and that chair needs to exert an equal force upward or else the chair will collapse.

For Example, when a bullet is fired from a gun, the gun only moves a little backwards (recoils) while the bullet can travel a large distance. This is because of the difference in the mass of the bullet and the gun.
Example: to open a door, either we push or pull it. A drawer is pulled to open and pushed to close.
Walking of a person - A person is able to walk because of the Newton’s Third Law of Motion. During walking, a person pushes the ground in backward direction and in the reaction the ground also pushes the person with equal magnitude of force but in opposite direction. This enables him to move in forward direction against the push.
Recoil of gun - When bullet is fired from a gun, the bullet also pushes the gun in opposite direction, with equal magnitude of force. This results in gunman feeling a backward push from the butt of gun.
Propulsion of a boat in forward direction – Sailor pushes water with oar in backward direction; resulting water pushing the oar in forward direction. Consequently, the boat is pushed in forward direction. Force applied by oar and water are of equal magnitude but in opposite directions.
Bullet and Gun – When bullet is fired from a gun, gun recoils in the opposite direction of bullet. The momentum of bullet is equal to momentum of gun. Since, the bullet is has very small mass compared to the gun, hence velocity of bullet is very high compared to the recoil of gun. In the case of firing of bullet, law of conservation of momentum is applied as usual.
In the collision of atoms, the conservation of momentum is applied.
In the game of snooker, when a ball is hit by stick, the conservation of momentum is applied.
When the mouth of an inflated balloon is let open, it starts flying, because of conservation of momentum.
When a cricket ball is hit by bat, the Law of Conservation of Momentum is applied.

Since, according to the Newton's Third Law of Motion, action of the object A (force exerted by A) will be equal to reaction of the object B(force exerted by B). But the force exerted in the course of action and reaction is in opposite direction.
Bullet and Gun – When bullet is fired from a gun, gun recoils in the opposite direction of bullet. The momentum of bullet is equal to momentum of gun. Since, the bullet is has very small mass compared to the gun, hence velocity of bullet is very high compared to the recoil of gun. In the case of firing of bullet, law of conservation of momentum is applied as usual.
Formulae------------------
Mathematical Formulation of Conservation of Momentum:Suppose that, two objects A and B are moving along a straight line in same direction and the velocity of A is greater than the velocity of B.Let the initial velocity of A=u1Let the initial velocity of B= u2Let the mass of A= m1Let the mass of B=m2Let both the objects collide after some time and collision lasts for ' t' second.Let the velocity of A after collision= v1Let the velocity of B after collision= v2
We know that, Momentum = Mass x VelocityTherefore, Momentum of  A ( FA) before collision  =m1 ×u1 Momentum of B (FB) before collision = m2 × u2 Momentum of A after collision = m1 × v1 Momentum of B after collision = m2 × v2 Now, we know that Rate of change of momentum = Mass x rate of change in velocity = mass x Change in velocity/time Therefore, rate of change of momentum of A during collision, FAB= m1(v1−u1t) Similarly the rate of change of momentum of B during collision, FBA = m2(v2 − u2t)
Since, according to the Newton's Third Law of Motion, action of the object A (force exerted by A) will be equal to reaction of the object B(force exerted by B). But the force exerted in the course of action and reaction is in opposite direction.
Therefore, F AB= − FBA ⇒ m1(v1− u1t) = − m2(v2− u2t) ⇒ m1(v1−u1)= − m2(v2 − u2) ⇒ m1v1 − m1u1 = −m2v2+ m2u2 ⇒ m1v1+ m2v2= m1u1+ m2u2 ⇒ m1u1+ m2u2 = m1v1+ m2v2---(i)

conservation of momentum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Conservation of momentum: If the external force on a system is zero, the momentum of the system remains constant i.e., in an isolated system, the total momentum remains conserved.
The sum of momenta of the two objects before collision is equal to the sum of momentum after the collision, provided there is no external unbalanced force acting on them. This is known as the law of conservation of momentum.
Conservation of linear momentum is based on newton’s second law of motion which states that in an isolated system the total momentum remains the same. Let’s consider the following example,
Types------------------
Effects------------------
It can change the speed of a body. It can change the direction of Force and Laws of Motion of a body. It can change the shape of a body.
Examples------------------
Consider this example of a balloon, the particles of gas move rapidly colliding with each other and the walls of the balloon, even though the particles themselves move faster and slower when they loose or gain momentum when they collide, the total momentum of the system remains the same. Hence, the balloon doesn’t change in size, if we add external energy by heating it, the balloon should expand because it increases the velocity of the particles and this increases their momentum in turn increasing the force exerted by them on the walls of the balloon.
Application------------------
Property------------------
Suppose A and B are two balls, they have mass mA and MB and initial velocities uA and uB as shown in above figure before collision. The two bodies collide and force is exerted by each body.
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
Let’s consider a case where a football of mass M2 is resting on the ground, a bowling ball with a comparatively heavier mass of M1 is thrown at the football at a velocity of U1.
When the bowling ball hits the football the energy is transferred and the bowling ball loses some velocity and moves at a new velocity V1, the football moves at velocity V2, why did the football move?
To conserve linear momentum, i.e. the bowling ball had an initial momentum of M1 so as M2<M1 and the momentum of football should be equal to the momentum lost by the bowling ball according to the law of conservation of momentum, the football had no other option than moving at a velocity V2.
Even though the momentum of each particle changes, altogether the momentum of the system remains constant as long as there is no external force acting on it. In a head to head car accident the momentum is transferred from one car to the other, but so much force is applied that the car structure cannot handle it, this is why a car wrecks. If the cars were able to deal with the amount of force, and the collision was elastic they both will move in opposite directions, considering their weights are same.
In short momentum is always conserved in any collision, whether it be an elastic or a non-elastic collision, though kinetic energy is not conserved in a non-elastic collision, the kinetic energy is converted into heat energy or potential energy etc.
Consider this example of a balloon, the particles of gas move rapidly colliding with each other and the walls of the balloon, even though the particles themselves move faster and slower when they loose or gain momentum when they collide, the total momentum of the system remains the same. Hence, the balloon doesn’t change in size, if we add external energy by heating it, the balloon should expand because it increases the velocity of the particles and this increases their momentum in turn increasing the force exerted by them on the walls of the balloon.

Force acting on unit area is called Pressure ie Pressure =   Force/Area

This explains why it is easier to hammer a nail into the wall. It is because we apply a greater amount of force into a very small area of the screw head. Going by the above equation, the force is large and the area is small. So, the pressure is very high.  There are instances when you also can feel pressure - when you are having a body massage. When a person massages your body with his hands, the force applied is very high on a relatively small area of his hand. The pressure is high and there is bearable but curative pain and pressure that you feel.

Definition------------------
Methods of Increasing and Reducing Friction
In real life, there are circumstances where we have to increase the friction and minimize the friction. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tires is done to increase friction. When friction is undesirable we have to reduce the friction. Friction can be minimized by using lubricants like oil and grease and by using ball bearing between machine parts. A substance that is introduced between two surfaces in contact, to reduce friction, is called a lubricant. Fluid friction can be minimized by giving suitable shapes to the objects moving in the fluids.
Types of Friction:
Static Friction: The minimum amount of force that is required to overcome the force of friction is called static friction. In other words, the minimum force that is required to make an object moving is called static friction.
Sliding Friction: Once an object starts moving on a surface, some force is required to keep the object moving. The minimum force that is required to keep a moving object in motion at a constant speed is called sliding friction. Sliding friction is always less than static friction. Due to this, it is easier to push a moving box compared to pushing a static box.
Rolling Friction: When an object rolls over a surface, the friction created is called rolling friction. Rolling friction is less than sliding friction.

Fluid Friction
When an object moves through a fluid, the fluids create friction. Friction created by a fluid is called fluid friction or drag. Force of friction is directly proportional to the density of a fluid. Hence, friction in oil will be greater than in water. Similarly, friction in water will be greater than that in air.
Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces of objects in contact. The force of friction always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force.
Friction is a type of forces that opposes motion. It is that forces which always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force. In case of a ball freely rolling on the ground, the ball eventually comes to stop, because of the force of friction that acts between the ball and the ground. When the rowing of a boat is stopped, the boat eventually comes to a halt because of friction. It also means that while rowing the force should be greater than the force of friction.
If force acts from right to left (<--), friction acts in left to right direction (-->) (See boat example)
If force acts from left to right (-->), friction acts in right to left direction (<--). (See football example)
Desirable Friction

Undesirable Friction

These are the instances where friction exists and is absolutely essential

These are the instances where friction exists, but it is undesirable

Examples

· To bring a rolling ball to stop (else it would keep rolling)

·Grooves on automobile tyres increase friction between tyres and the rough road surface. They provide more grip

· Cleats on sports shoes provide better stability to the sportsman with the ground

· Rough sand paper is used to smooth wood

Examples

·Automobile parts, machine parts begin to  degrade over a period of time due to friction

·The sole of our shoes wears out after prolonged use because of friction with the rough road surface.

·When there are dry areas on a water slide, the slide fall will not be very smooth.

Such type of friction should be retained or increased

Such type of friction should be minimized
Lubricants: In case of automobiles and machine-parts which tend to get screechy or ineffective over a period of time, we apply substances to make their surfaces smooth and thereby reduce friction. These are called lubricants.  You must have seen specific lubricants for automobile parts in petrol stations. Also, you must have noticed that we apply oil to screechy doors in our houses.
Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces of objects in contact. The force of friction always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force. Friction exists between two surfaces due to irregularities on the surfaces of the objects in contact, interlocking of micro-level irregularities of the two surfaces and ploughing of harder surfaces into smoother surfaces.
The frictional force exerted by fluids when objects move through them is called fluid friction or drag.

Effects------------------
Friction Produces Heat
You know that friction produces heat. That's why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure below. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat.
How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.
Friction is always parallel to the surface in contact.
In some cases, friction is desirable while in other cases, friction reduces the effectiveness of machines. Without friction, you would not be able to walk, the wheels on a vehicle would have no grip on a road surfacing and the vehicle would not be able to move forward.On the other hand, friction is undesirable in most of the cases. Friction causes mechanical parts to seize and wear out.

Benefits of Friction
It is not possible to even walk on the road; in the absence of friction. Walking on ice is almost impossible because of lack of friction.
Friction is necessary to keep a ladder against a wall. The ladder will not find grip against the wall in the absence of friction.
It is very difficult to drive on a wet road because of less friction. A thin film of water is made over the surface of road. This thin film of water greatly reduces friction. Due to this, the driver finds it difficult to control the vehicle while driving on a wet road.
Friction: A Necessary Evil:
Friction is a necessary evil because it has both harmful and beneficial effects.
Examples:
(i) We can walk easily because ground offers friction. In the less friction walking situation becomes almost impossible. Therefore, friction is necessary even a simple task like walking.
(ii) It is difficult task to move on a wet muddy track, or wet marble floor. This is because these surfaces offer very small friction to the surface of feet of a person.
(iii) Soles of shoes have grooves on them. Grooved soles give more friction to the ground which gives better grip when we walk. Shoes with worn out soles can be slippery.
(iv) The tyres of vehicles have treads for better grip over road. It provides friction to the surface of road. When treads are worn out, the tyres need to be replaced with new one.
(v) Friction can also produce heat. Vigorously rub your palms together for a few minutes.
(vi) Writing with pen is possible because paper provides friction to the tip of pen.
(vii)When a machine is operated, heat generated causes much wastage of energy.
Effects of Friction
•  Friction produces heat.
•  Friction causes wear and tear.
•  Friction opposes motion.
Increasing Friction: By pressing the surfaces together more strongly. For e.g. when brakes are applied on a bicycle or car, the brake pads press against a moving part of the wheel and the force of friction increases. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tyres is done to increase friction.
Reducing Friction: Friction between the sliding surfaces of two objects can be reduced by making the surfaces in contact smooth by polishing them. Friction is reduced by providing wheels, e.g. suitcase, school bags of kids, etc.

(i) In Some situations, friction is undesirable. We need to reduce it.
(ii) With help of lubricant we can reduce the friction. Lubricants make a thin layer over surface and facilitate smooth movement.
(iii) In the engines of vehicles, use of lubricants increases the efficiency as parts are not rubbed directly each other because of thin layer of lubricant.
(iv) In many machines, graphite powder, oil, grease are used as lubricant for reducing friction.
(v) Few drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door for reducing friction, the door moves smoothly.
(vi) While playing carom, sprinkle fine powder over it to reduce friction.

Have you ever wondered how a rolling ball eventually comes to a halt. Why is that we cannot hold a glass firmly when our hands are oily? Why do our shoes get worn out after some days of use? Why are there wheels attached to luggage trolleys? Why do we tend to slip on a wet floor? These are due to 'Friction'. In this chapter, we will study about Friction and its characteristics.
Smooth surfaces have lesser irregularities. The lesser the irregularities, the lesser the tendency to lock. The lesser the tendency to lock with another object, the lesser the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls faster and covers a greater a distance on a smooth surface such as a marble floor or a wet floor. Think of the bowling game.
Rough surfaces have more irregularities. The more the irregularities, the more tendency to lock. The more the tendency to lock, the more the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls slowly and covers a lesser distance on a rough surface such as muddy play ground. Think of a rough muddy playground. So, it obviously means that to get the ball rolling we have to apply a force which is greater than the frictional force offered by the ground.
This also explains why we cannot hold a glass with oily hands.  Our hands are greasy and smooth and we know that smooth offers lesser interaction or lock with the glass. And hence it tends to slip.
While trekking on hilly and watery terrains, we wear groovy sports shoes so that rough shoes establish better locking with the hilly trains, increase friction, provide more grip and decrease chances of a slip.
We mentioned above that undesirable friction should be reduced. Here are some of the ways to reduce Friction.

There are instances in daily life where friction is a necessity. For example, without friction, we cannot hold objects in our hands; we cannot walk and cannot light a match stick. Sometimes friction is not desirable, for example  friction between machinery parts, which causes wear and tear. As friction is advantageous to us it is considered as a friend but due to its disadvantages it is a foe. Depending on the circumstance, friction can be a help or a hindrance. Thus it is a necessary evil. 
INCREASING AND REDUCING FRICTION
To increase friction, the surface is roughened or grooved. For e.g. Soles of the shoes are grooved.
To reduce friction, the surface is smoothened or lubricated. For e.g. Grease is used to reduce the friction between the moving parts of vehicles.
Application------------------
Fluid Friction
When an object moves through a fluid, the fluids create friction. Friction created by a fluid is called fluid friction or drag. Force of friction is directly proportional to the density of a fluid. Hence, friction in oil will be greater than in water. Similarly, friction in water will be greater than that in air.
Factors affecting Friction:
(i) Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact.
(ii) Even those surfaces which appear very smooth but microscopic view show those irregularities. When these surfaces come into contact, the irregularities of surfaces get interlocked. We have to apply force to remove the interlocking, a surface produces friction when it slides or rolls over another surface. 
(iii) Friction force will increase with increase in weight. As weight increases irregularities between surfaces get interlocked tightly because of pressure, and the surface offers more resistance of friction.
Example: It is easier to dragging a mat when nobody is sitting on it than a person is sitting on it because of friction increases with increase in weight.
(iv) Rougher surface offers more force of friction.

Types of Friction:
Static Friction: The minimum amount of force that is required to overcome the force of friction is called static friction. In other words, the minimum force that is required to make an object moving is called static friction.
Sliding Friction: Once an object starts moving on a surface, some force is required to keep the object moving. The minimum force that is required to keep a moving object in motion at a constant speed is called sliding friction. Sliding friction is always less than static friction. Due to this, it is easier to push a moving box compared to pushing a static box.
Rolling Friction: When an object rolls over a surface, the friction created is called rolling friction. Rolling friction is less than sliding friction.

Benefits of Friction
It is not possible to even walk on the road; in the absence of friction. Walking on ice is almost impossible because of lack of friction.
Friction is necessary to keep a ladder against a wall. The ladder will not find grip against the wall in the absence of friction.
It is very difficult to drive on a wet road because of less friction. A thin film of water is made over the surface of road. This thin film of water greatly reduces friction. Due to this, the driver finds it difficult to control the vehicle while driving on a wet road.
Ways to Increase Friction
Rubber grips are put on bicycle handles, electrical tools and on many other tools. Increased friction helps in giving better grip on these objects.
A surface can be made rough with the help of sand paper; in order to increase friction.
Soles of shoes are made rough to increase friction. This helps in providing better grip on surface while walking.
Treads of tyres are deliberately made so that a good road grip can be achieved with the help of friction.
Holding a bottle cap with a thick towel helps in increasing friction. Increased friction makes it easier to open the bottle cap.
Ways to Reduce Friction
Lubricating oil and grease are used in machines to reduce friction between moving parts.
Some machines use air cushion for reducing friction because use of oil is not ideal in such machines.
Graphite powder is used in some machines to reduce friction.
Ball bearing coverts sliding friction into rolling friction. You have read that rolling friction is less than sliding friction. Thus, ball bearing helps in reducing friction.
Fluid Friction
When an object moves through a fluid, the fluids create friction. Friction created by a fluid is called fluid friction or drag. Force of friction is directly proportional to the density of a fluid. Hence, friction in oil will be greater than in water. Similarly, friction in water will be greater than that in air.
Factors affecting Friction:
(i) Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact.
(ii) Even those surfaces which appear very smooth but microscopic view show those irregularities. When these surfaces come into contact, the irregularities of surfaces get interlocked. We have to apply force to remove the interlocking, a surface produces friction when it slides or rolls over another surface. 
(iii) Friction force will increase with increase in weight. As weight increases irregularities between surfaces get interlocked tightly because of pressure, and the surface offers more resistance of friction.
Example: It is easier to dragging a mat when nobody is sitting on it than a person is sitting on it because of friction increases with increase in weight.
(iv) Rougher surface offers more force of friction.

Friction: A Necessary Evil:
Friction is a necessary evil because it has both harmful and beneficial effects.
Examples:
(i) We can walk easily because ground offers friction. In the less friction walking situation becomes almost impossible. Therefore, friction is necessary even a simple task like walking.
(ii) It is difficult task to move on a wet muddy track, or wet marble floor. This is because these surfaces offer very small friction to the surface of feet of a person.
(iii) Soles of shoes have grooves on them. Grooved soles give more friction to the ground which gives better grip when we walk. Shoes with worn out soles can be slippery.
(iv) The tyres of vehicles have treads for better grip over road. It provides friction to the surface of road. When treads are worn out, the tyres need to be replaced with new one.
(v) Friction can also produce heat. Vigorously rub your palms together for a few minutes.
(vi) Writing with pen is possible because paper provides friction to the tip of pen.
(vii)When a machine is operated, heat generated causes much wastage of energy.
Increase of friction:
(i) Friction is desirable in some situations
(ii) Friction is necessary for us, therefore friction is increased to accomplish Some of important task.
Examples:
(a) Treaded tyres of vehicle increase friction. Vehicle with treaded tyres provides mores friction which gives better grip with the road.
(b)  Soles of shoes are treaded to increase friction between sole and the ground.
(c)  Javelin thrower rubs some powder on his palm to get better grip on the javelin.
(d)  Kabaddi players rub their hands with soil for a better grip of their opponents.


Reduction of friction:
(i) In Some situations, friction is undesirable. We need to reduce it.
(ii) With help of lubricant we can reduce the friction. Lubricants make a thin layer over surface and facilitate smooth movement.
(iii) In the engines of vehicles, use of lubricants increases the efficiency as parts are not rubbed directly each other because of thin layer of lubricant.
(iv) In many machines, graphite powder, oil, grease are used as lubricant for reducing friction.
(v) Few drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door for reducing friction, the door moves smoothly.
(vi) While playing carom, sprinkle fine powder over it to reduce friction.


Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces of objects in contact. The force of friction always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force.
Factors That Affect Friction
•  Roughness of the surface
•  The extent to which the two surfaces press together
•  Nature of the surface
Advantages of Friction
•  Friction between pen and paper enables us to write on the paper.
•  Friction between our feet and the ground allows our movements like standing, walking and running.
•  Friction between the surface of the road and tyres of our vehicles allow the vehicles to move without slipping.
Disadvantages of Friction
•  Friction causes moving objects to stop or slow down.
•  Friction produces heat causing wastage of energy in machines.
•  Friction causes wear and tear of moving parts of machinery, soles of shoes, etc.
Friction is a necessary Evil: As friction is advantageous to us it is considered as a friend but due to its disadvantages it is a foe. Depending on the circumstance, friction can be a help or a hindrance. Thus it is a necessary evil.
Increasing Friction: By pressing the surfaces together more strongly. For e.g. when brakes are applied on a bicycle or car, the brake pads press against a moving part of the wheel and the force of friction increases. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tyres is done to increase friction.
Reducing Friction: Friction between the sliding surfaces of two objects can be reduced by making the surfaces in contact smooth by polishing them. Friction is reduced by providing wheels, e.g. suitcase, school bags of kids, etc.


Friction is a type of forces that opposes motion. It is that forces which always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force. In case of a ball freely rolling on the ground, the ball eventually comes to stop, because of the force of friction that acts between the ball and the ground. When the rowing of a boat is stopped, the boat eventually comes to a halt because of friction. It also means that while rowing the force should be greater than the force of friction.
If force acts from right to left (<--), friction acts in left to right direction (-->) (See boat example)
If force acts from left to right (-->), friction acts in right to left direction (<--). (See football example)
As we studied in the previous case, friction is caused by the interaction between the surfaces which are in contact. Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces which are in contact. The irregularities on both surfaces tend to lock into each other and this resists the motion of the object. The nature of the surface (smoothness or roughness) affects the friction.
Smooth surfaces have lesser irregularities. The lesser the irregularities, the lesser the tendency to lock. The lesser the tendency to lock with another object, the lesser the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls faster and covers a greater a distance on a smooth surface such as a marble floor or a wet floor. Think of the bowling game.
Rough surfaces have more irregularities. The more the irregularities, the more tendency to lock. The more the tendency to lock, the more the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls slowly and covers a lesser distance on a rough surface such as muddy play ground. Think of a rough muddy playground. So, it obviously means that to get the ball rolling we have to apply a force which is greater than the frictional force offered by the ground.
Desirable Friction

Undesirable Friction

These are the instances where friction exists and is absolutely essential

These are the instances where friction exists, but it is undesirable

Examples

· To bring a rolling ball to stop (else it would keep rolling)

·Grooves on automobile tyres increase friction between tyres and the rough road surface. They provide more grip

· Cleats on sports shoes provide better stability to the sportsman with the ground

· Rough sand paper is used to smooth wood

Examples

·Automobile parts, machine parts begin to  degrade over a period of time due to friction

·The sole of our shoes wears out after prolonged use because of friction with the rough road surface.

·When there are dry areas on a water slide, the slide fall will not be very smooth.

Such type of friction should be retained or increased

Such type of friction should be minimized
Rough surfaces increase friction. Smooth surfaces decrease friction.
We mentioned above that undesirable friction should be reduced. Here are some of the ways to reduce Friction.

Lubricants
Wheels
Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces of objects in contact. The force of friction always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force. Friction exists between two surfaces due to irregularities on the surfaces of the objects in contact, interlocking of micro-level irregularities of the two surfaces and ploughing of harder surfaces into smoother surfaces.
Methods of Increasing and Reducing Friction
In real life, there are circumstances where we have to increase the friction and minimise the friction. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tyres is done to increase friction. When friction is undesirable we have to reduce the friction. Friction can be minimised by using lubricants like oil and grease and by using ball bearing between machine parts. A substance that is introduced between two surfaces in contact, to reduce friction, is called a lubricant. Fluid friction can be minimised by giving suitable shapes to the objects moving in the fluids.
Friction is less on a smooth surface.
Surfaces pressed hard against each other have more friction between each other.
INCREASING AND REDUCING FRICTION
To increase friction, the surface is roughened or grooved. For e.g. Soles of the shoes are grooved.
To reduce friction, the surface is smoothened or lubricated. For e.g. Grease is used to reduce the friction between the moving parts of vehicles.
REDUCING FRICTION USING WHEELS
Rolling friction is less than sliding friction. Therefore, wheels are used in luggage bags so they can be moved easily.
Causes------------------
Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, Why does this make your hands warmer? The answer is friction.
Why Friction Occurs
Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure below. The aluminum foil is so smooth that it's shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal. This creates friction.

Factors that Affect Friction
Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. That's why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. Increasing the area of surfaces that are touching also increases the friction between them. That's why you can't slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the thin blades of skates. The greater surface area of the soles of the shoes cause more friction and slow you down.
Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why?Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them.
How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.
Friction is always parallel to the surface in contact.
In some cases, friction is desirable while in other cases, friction reduces the effectiveness of machines. Without friction, you would not be able to walk, the wheels on a vehicle would have no grip on a road surfacing and the vehicle would not be able to move forward.On the other hand, friction is undesirable in most of the cases. Friction causes mechanical parts to seize and wear out.
Factors Affecting Friction:
Irregularities on surfaces: Friction is created because of irregularities on surfaces. The irregularities on surfaces result in interlocking of two surfaces. The interlocking between two surfaces creates friction. Hence, the force of friction will be greater in case of rough surface than in case of smooth surface.

Pressure Between two Surfaces: The force of friction increases with increase in pressure between two surfaces. You must have seen that moving a heavy box is difficult compared to moving a light box. Pressure is higher in case of a heavy box.
Harms of Friction
It results in wear and tear of shoes and tyres, machine parts, clothes, etc. It causes monetary loss.
Heat is generated by friction, which results in wastage of energy. Moreover, a significant amount of energy is wasted in overcoming friction.
Causes of Friction: Friction exists between two surfaces due to irregularities on the surfaces of the objects in contact, interlocking of micro-level irregularities of the two surfaces and ploughing of harder surfaces into smoother surfaces.

Friction Produces Heat
You know that friction produces heat. That's why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure below. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat.
How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.

Friction Is A Necessary Evil 
There are instances in daily life where friction is a necessity. For example, without friction, we cannot hold objects in our hands; we cannot walk and cannot light a match stick. Sometimes friction is not desirable, for example friction between machinery parts, which causes wear and tear. As friction is advantageous to us it is considered as a friend but due to its disadvantages it is a foe. Depending on the circumstance, friction can be a help or a hindrance. Thus it is a necessary evil.
Friction: A Necessary Evil
Friction is all pervasive. Even a simple task; like writing on a page; cannot be done without friction. Walking on road won’t be possible because friction. But friction causes wear and tear of materials, and wastage of energy. Thus, friction is beneficial as well as harmful. Hence, friction is called a necessary evil.


Benefits of Friction

This also explains why we cannot hold a glass with oily hands.  Our hands are greasy and smooth and we know that smooth offers lesser interaction or lock with the glass. And hence it tends to slip.
While trekking on hilly and watery terrains, we wear groovy sports shoes so that rough shoes establish better locking with the hilly trains, increase friction, provide more grip and decrease chances of a slip.
Wheels: We have seen luggage trolleys use wheels. It is easier to pull heavy loads with wheels  as against pulling/pushing them along the ground.
The friction between a match stick and match box helps light the match stick and so.
When you rub your palms together for a few seconds, they become warm

static friction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Static Friction: When a body is at rest, the force of friction is called the static friction and is always equal and opposite to the applied force. The force of friction which acts when the body is just at the verge of sliding on the surface is called limiting friction.


Types of Friction
There are three types of friction that exist between solid surfaces. They are static friction, sliding friction and rolling friction. Frictional force that comes into action before the start of the motion of an object is called static friction.  Example: a box placed on the floor. When an object slides over another surface, the frictional force that comes into action is sliding friction. Example:  a boy sliding on a slide. The frictional force exerted when an object rolls over a surface is called rolling friction. Example:  rolling ball on the ground. It is found that: 

Rolling friction < sliding friction < static friction.

Static Friction
Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure below). Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk. In fact, that's exactly what happens if you try to walk on ice. That's because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction.

fluid friction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Fluid Friction
Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid. A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you've ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you've experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure below. He's falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That's why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver's body.
Fluid Friction:
(i) Gases and liquids are generally known as fluid. Similar to solid, fluids also provide friction. The friction of fluid increases with the speed of object moving through it and speed of fluid.
(ii) Objects which are made to move in fluid are made streamlined shape to reduce friction offered by fluid. The shape of aeroplane, ship, boat, birds and fish are made streamlined shape. A shape which is pointed on both ends and wide at the middle is called streamlined shape which facilitates easier movement through fluids.
(iii) The frictional force offered by fluids is called drag.


Fluids (means liquids and gases) too  exert friction on the objects. The frictional force exerted by fluids is called a drag. Since water and air too exert friction on the bodies that move in them like the boat, fishes (in water), aeroplane  and birds, their physical structure should be such that they can oppose this friction and move forward.

Notice the similarities between the physical structure of an aeroplane (man-made) and that of an bird and also a boat(man-made) and that of a fish.
FLUID FRICTION
Gases and liquids are commonly known as fluids. The frictional force exerted by fluids is called fluid friction or drag,
Fluid friction can be reduced by streamlining the body. Streamlining is changing the shape of an object in such a way that the drag is minimum.

Notice the similarities between the physical structure of an aeroplane (man-made) and that of an bird and also a boat(man-made) and that of a fish.
FLUID FRICTION
Gases and liquids are commonly known as fluids. The frictional force exerted by fluids is called fluid friction or drag,
Fluid friction can be reduced by streamlining the body. Streamlining is changing the shape of an object in such a way that the drag is minimum.
Causes------------------
Fluid Friction
Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid. A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you've ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you've experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure below. He's falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That's why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver's body.

Types of Friction
There are three types of friction that exist between solid surfaces. They are static friction, sliding friction and rolling friction. Frictional force that comes into action before the start of the motion of an object is called static friction.  Example: a box placed on the floor. When an object slides over another surface, the frictional force that comes into action is sliding friction. Example:  a boy sliding on a slide. The frictional force exerted when an object rolls over a surface is called rolling friction. Example:  rolling ball on the ground. It is found that:

sound!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Introduction to Sound
Sound is a form of energy that travels in the form of vibrations through the air or any another medium.
Vibration is defined as a rapid to and fro or up and down movement about a mean position.
Vibrations travel through a medium such as air and reach our ears where they are interpreted by the brain as sound.
Human beings are capable of producing sound which originates from the larynx or the voice box in the neck. The sound produced is controlled by thin membranous structures known as vocal cords that stretch across the larynx.
The vibrating body can be- a stretched animal hide (as in drums and table), stretched strings (as in guitar and sitar), or air columns (as in flute or pipes).
Audible and inaudible sounds:
Audible sounds are those that can be heard while inaudible sounds are those that cannot be heard.
Human can hear sounds with frequency between 20Hz and 20,000Hz.
Low frequency sounds which cannot be hear are called infrasonics.
Objects that vibrate at frequencies of above 20,000Hz produce sound which also cannot be heard by us. Such sounds are called ultrasonics.
Sound:
(i) Sound is a form of energy like heat energy, light energy, potential energy and kinetic energy. It causes a sensation of hearing in our ears.
(ii) Sound helps us communicate with each other. 


Production of Sound:
(i) Sound is produced due to the vibration of object.
(ii) The motion of materials or objects causes vibration.
(iii) Vibration is a kind of rapid to and fro motion of an object a central position. It is also referred to as oscillation.
Examples:
(a) A stretched rubber band when plucked vibrates and produces sound.
(b) In the music room of your school you hear the sounds made by musical instruments like flute, tabla, harmonium, guitar  etc. because of vibration.
(c) When a spoon is beaten on the plate, it starts vibrating and produces sound.
Sound Produced by Humans:
(i) In humans sound is produced because of vibration of his voice box or larynx.
(ii) It is situated at the upper end of windpipe. There are two stretched membranes called vocal cords attached in larynx with a narrow slit between them for passes air.
(iii) Muscles attached to the vocal cords can make the cords tight or loose. When the vocal cords are tight and thin, produce different type or quality of voice.

A variety of metrics are used to measure soundï¿½s intensity, volume and pitch. The pitch of sound is measures in hertz. One hertz (Hz) refers to the complete cycle of sound waves per second. Thus, 5,000Hz is equal to 5,000 cycles per second.
Pitch of Sound: Pitch of sound depends on frequency of vibration. A high pitched sound has high frequency, while a low pitched sound has low frequency. Children and women generally produce sound with high pitch.
Higher the frequency of vibration, the higher is the pitch, and shriller is the sound.


Characteristics of Sounds:

(i) Loudness: The sensation produced in the ear which enables us to distinguish between a loud and a faint sound. Larger the amplitude of vibration, the louder is the sound produced. It is proportional to square of the amplitude.

(ii) Pitch: The characteristics of sound which distinguishes between a shrill sound and a soft sound. Higher the frequency of vibration, higher is the pitch and shrillness.

(iii) Quality: Characteristic which enables us to distinguish between musical notes emitted by different musical instruments or voices even though they have the same pitch and loudness.
Pitch and loudness of sound The pitch of sound (shrillness or flatness) depends on the frequency of vibration. If the frequency is high, the sound has high pitch and if the frequency is low, the sound has low pitch
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
Examples:
(i) Children and women produce high frequency sound so their sound is shriller or higher pitch. On the other hand, an adult male produces lower frequency sound so his sound is less shrill or lower pitch.
(ii) A drum produces lower frequency sound which is less shrill or lower pitch, while a whistle produces higher frequency sound which is shriller or higher pitch.
Formulae------------------
Loudness and Pitch:
1. Loudness:
(i) Loudness of sound is the measure of sound energy reaching the ear per second.
(ii) Loudness or softness of a sound depends upon its amplitude.
(iii) Loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound.

                               Loudness  α  (Amplitude)2
If the amplitude becomes twice, the loudness increases by a factor of 4.
(iv) Loudness of sound is measured in decibel (dB).

sound and hearing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Outer Ear:
It consists of the pinna, ear canal, and the eardrum or the tympanum. The pinna gathers the sound waves and then leads to the ear canal from where they strike the eardrum.
Middle Ear:
The vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to three closely-packed bones called the hammer, anvil and stirrup. These three bones finally transmit the vibrations to the inner ear.
Audible and inaudible sounds:
Audible sounds are those that can be heard while inaudible sounds are those that cannot be heard.
Human can hear sounds with frequency between 20Hz and 20,000Hz.
Low frequency sounds which cannot be hear are called infrasonics.
Objects that vibrate at frequencies of above 20,000Hz produce sound which also cannot be heard by us. Such sounds are called ultrasonics.
Audible and Inaudible Sound:
(i) Sounds of frequency range between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz are called audible sound. The human beings can hear the sound range between 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz.
(ii) Sound of frequency below 20 hertz and above 20,000 hertz is called sound of inaudible range. Humans cannot hear the sound of inaudible range.
(iii) Many animals, such as dogs, cats, etc. can hear the sound with frequency above 20,000 hertz.
Sound is produced by a vibrating body. In other words, any vibrating body would always produce sound. Sometimes, the vibration is clearly visible and the sound is strong, whereas in some cases, the vibration is small and the sound is feeble. (Note : The to and fro or back and forth motion of a body is termed as vibration or oscillatory motion). When the diaphragm of a drum is struck, it vibrates and produces sound. When the strings in a violin vibrates, it produces sound. When the air column vibrates within a flute, it produces sound. As seen, different parts of the musical instruments (diaphragm of the drum, strings of violin, air column within in flute) vibrate to produce sound.


Hearing Aid- The Hearing Aid contains a microphone which receives the sound from the outer atmosphere and converts it into electrical energy. This electrical energy is passed through an amplifier which amplifies the sound and then moves it to a speaker. The speaker then converts the electrical signal into sound waves and sends it to the ear and provides a clear hearing.
Range of Hearing.Human beings can hear sound frequencies between 20 Hz and 2000 Hz., called as audible range of sound.Sound whose frequency is less than 20 Hz is called infrasonic sound.Sound whose frequency is more than 2000 Hz is called ultrasonic sound
Types------------------

Examples------------------
The human ear can generally perceive sound between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Animals can often hear sound that humans canï¿½t. For example, dogs can hear sounds at very high frequencies ï¿½ often above 20,000Hz ï¿½ but cannot hear low frequency sounds.
Have you heard the following sounds  - Sitar, Violin, Veena, your favorite song playing in your iPod, temple bells, chirping of birds, vehicles horning in traffic, dogs bark, pressure cooker whistling, crackers bursting, rattling and breaking of objects etc. While some sounds may be pleasant and soothing, some could be annoying. But all these are Sounds. In this chapter, we will study about these Sounds, how we speak, how we hear, their characteristics and so on

How does human hear sound?
Sound travels in the form of waves of vibrating air molecules. When these waves reach our ears we hear the sound.
Outer Ear:
It consists of the pinna, ear canal, and the eardrum or the tympanum. The pinna gathers the sound waves and then leads to the ear canal from where they strike the eardrum.
Middle Ear:
The vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to three closely-packed bones called the hammer, anvil and stirrup. These three bones finally transmit the vibrations to the inner ear.
Inner Ear:
This consists of cochlea, which is a long coiled tube. It contains a fluid and has numerous cells with hair. These sensitive hair cells transmit the vibrations to the brain through the auditory nerve, for the brain to register the sound.
Audible and inaudible sounds:
Audible sounds are those that can be heard while inaudible sounds are those that cannot be heard.
Human can hear sounds with frequency between 20Hz and 20,000Hz.
Low frequency sounds which cannot be hear are called infrasonics.
Objects that vibrate at frequencies of above 20,000Hz produce sound which also cannot be heard by us. Such sounds are called ultrasonics.
The human ear can generally perceive sound between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Animals can often hear sound that humans canï¿½t. For example, dogs can hear sounds at very high frequencies ï¿½ often above 20,000Hz ï¿½ but cannot hear low frequency sounds.
Sound requires two components to be audible to the human ear: vibration, as well as amplification. Amplification can be provided by physical devices like the hollow body of a guitar, or by electrical hi-fi systems and speakers.
Sound is produced by a vibrating body. In other words, any vibrating body would always produce sound. Sometimes, the vibration is clearly visible and the sound is strong, whereas in some cases, the vibration is small and the sound is feeble. (Note : The to and fro or back and forth motion of a body is termed as vibration or oscillatory motion). When the diaphragm of a drum is struck, it vibrates and produces sound. When the strings in a violin vibrates, it produces sound. When the air column vibrates within a flute, it produces sound. As seen, different parts of the musical instruments (diaphragm of the drum, strings of violin, air column within in flute) vibrate to produce sound.


Our ears allow us to receive audible frequencies in our surroundings. They then convert these sounds into electrical signals which are then passed through a special nerve called the auditory nerve to our brain. The brain that interprets these signals and responds accordingly.

echoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
The echo:
Sound heard after reflection from a surface is called echo.
Just like heat or light, when sound falls on a surface, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.
Soft surfaces are better absorbers of sound whereas hard surfaces are better reflectors of sound.
Uses of Echo:
Echo is used in SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) to find the depth of seas or distance of submarines.
In concert halls, echo is desirable to some extent, because it enhances the sound and produces a pleasing effect.
Bats use the principle of echolocation to avoid hitting against obstacles in their path.
Echo. If we shout or clap near a reflecting surface like tall building or a mountain, we hear the same sound again. This sound which we hear is called echo. It is caused due to the reflection of sound. To hear an echo clearly, the time interval between the original sound and the echo must be at least 0.1 s. Since the speed of sound in air is 344 m/s, the distance travelled by sound in 0.I s = 344. So to hear an echo clearly, the minimum distance of the reflecting surface should be half this distance that is 17.2 m.

One of the biggest challenges audio engineers and producers face is reducing echoes in studios and live performance venues.

Since sound is created by vibration, the best way to reduce echoes is by installing a material that absorbs energy. This is why most studios have foam padding on their walls, or thick carpets designed to prevent sound reflecting and causing an echo.

Musical sounds:
The sounds produced by a tuning fork, violin, veena, flute and piano are pleasing to the ear. They are called musical sounds. They are produced by regular, periodic vibrations.
Stringed instruments:
Stringed instruments make use of a string or wire to produce vibrations and sound. The frequency of sound is varied by varying the length of the vibrating wire.
In a sitar, the shorter the length of the wire, the higher the pitch it produces.

Wind instruments:
Wind instruments use the principle of a vibrating air column to produce sound. The frequency is varied by changing the length of the vibrating air column.
Flute, shehnai and clarinet are some well known wind instruments.
Percussion instruments:
They are instruments in which vibrations of a stretched animal hide produce sound. The frequency of vibration can be increased by stretching the hide more.
Table, drums and mrindangam are some examples of percussion instruments.
Sound is produced by a vibrating body. In other words, any vibrating body would always produce sound. Sometimes, the vibration is clearly visible and the sound is strong, whereas in some cases, the vibration is small and the sound is feeble.

Letï¿½s start with the guitar. Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibration of their strings. This sound is amplified by the guitarï¿½s hollow body, and the different strings each produce a different frequency ï¿½ and thus different pitch ï¿½ of sound.
The neck of a guitar contains anywhere from 12 to 24 frets. By pressing on each of these frets, the player changes the tension of the string, leading to a new frequency and a different pitch of note or chord.
On a piano, sound is created in almost exactly the same way. Instead of plucking the strings, piano players push keys which trigger hammers that push the strings inside the piano. The body of the piano amplifies this sound just like the body of a guitar.
If youï¿½ve ever taken the protective covers off a pair of hi-fi speakers, youï¿½ll know that they vibrate when you play music. Speakers produce sound using vibration, just like a piano or guitar. However, the design of speakers lets them create a far wider range of sounds than a piano or guitar could produce.
Instead of using human energy to create vibration, like the plucking motion used to play a guitar or the tap of a piano keyï¿½s hammer, speakers convert electrical energy into vibration which, in turn, produces sound. Digital audio production software often includes a live view of sound waves as they are playing. The peaks in this view are the periods at which sound is loudest. This is when your speakers will be vibrating the most.

Definition------------------
Propagation of Sound:
(i) The travelling of sound is called propagation of sound.
(ii) Sound is propagated by the to and fro motion of particles of the medium.
Sound needs a medium to propagate:
(i) A medium is necessary for the propagation of sound waves.
(ii) The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium. The medium can be solid, liquid or gas.
(iii) Sound cannot travel in vacuum. A true vacuum refers to the complete absence of matter. Sound wave can travel only through matter. So, sound needs a physical medium in order to propagate anywhere.
(iv) We hear sound which comes to us through air medium particles.
(v)Aquatic animals communicate as sound travels through water.
Sound needs a medium to propagateThe traveling of sound is called propagation of sound. Sound cannot propagate in the absence of a medium. The place where there is no air or air is removed, is called vacuum. Sound does not propagate (travels) through vacuum.Sound travels through solid, liquid and gas.We usually hear sound which comes to us through air.Aquatic animals communicate as sound travels through water also.We hear the sound through ear
Propagation of Sound When an object vibrates, the particles around the medium vibrate. The particle in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position.
The disturbance produced by the vibrating body travels through the medium but the particles do not move forward themselves. A wave is a disturbance which moves through a medium by the vibration of the particles of the medium. So sound is considered as a wave. Sound waves Require medium for transmission.
A vibrating object producing a series of compressions (C) and rarefaction (R). In these waves the particles move back and forth parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. Such waves are called longitudinal waves.
Sound propagates in a medium as a series of compressions (C) and rare factions (R). Compressions are the regions of high pressure and density where the particles are crowded andare represented by the upper portion of the curve called crest. Rarefactions are the regions of low pressure and density where the particles are spread out and are represented by the lower portion of the curve called trough.

Sound Needs a Medium for Propagation
Sound needs a medium through which it can travel. Sound cannot travel through vacuum. Sound can travel through solid, liquid. Propagation of sound happens in all directions in a medium.
Sound can propagate through solids, liquids and gases. In fact, it needs a medium to propagate, be it solid, liquid or gases. It cannot propagate through vacuum.
SOUND AND MEDIUM FOR PROPAGATION
Sound requires a medium for propagation. Sound travels through solid, liquid and air.

human ear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Human Ear
Human ear; which gives us the sense of hearing is a complex structure. It can be divided into three main parts, viz. external ear, middle ear and internal ear.
The human ear can detect sounds in the range of 20Hz-20KHz. These are called Audible Sounds. Eg: Music, Instruments, Crackers.
Frequencies below 20Hz and greater than 20KHz cannot be heard by the human ear. These are called Inaudible Sounds. Eg: It is believed that bat calls are in the inaudible ultrasonics range. Dogs can hear frequencies greater than 20KHz, so they are used by the police to respond to such whistles. Ultrasound scans produce sounds in this range.
The Middle Ear – It consists of three bones (hammer, anvil and stirrup). These bones amplify the vibrations produced by the eardrum. These vibrations are then passed onto the inner ear by the middle ear.
Types------------------
Effects------------------
Examples------------------
The human ear can generally perceive sound between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Animals can often hear sound that humans canï¿½t. For example, dogs can hear sounds at very high frequencies ï¿½ often above 20,000Hz ï¿½ but cannot hear low frequency sounds.

Human Ear
Human ear; which gives us the sense of hearing is a complex structure. It can be divided into three main parts, viz. external ear, middle ear and internal ear.
External Ear: The external ear or pinna appears like a funnel. Its function is to catch sound waves and to direct them towards middle ear.
Middle Ear: The middle ear is composed of a stretched membrane and three small bones. The stretched membrane is called the ear drum and small bones are called bony ossicles. These are named sequentially from outside to inside as; malleus, incus, and stapes (hammer, anvil, and stirrup). When sound wave comes to the middle ear, it sets vibrations in the ear drum. After that, sound waves are transferred from ear drum transfers these vibrations to the three bones.
Internal Ear: The internal ear is composed of cochlea and semicircular canals. Cochlea appears like a snail from outside. Vibrations from middle ear reach the cochlea. Signals from cochlea reach the brain and we hear a sound. Semicircular canals have no role in sense of hearing, rather they maintain the balance of the body.
The shape of our outer ear is like a funnel. Sound waves enters inside. It travels down a canal and at the end of it, touches a thin stretched membrane called the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates to the effect of the sound. The ear passes on these vibrations to the inner ear and then there to the brain, which processes it. That is how we hear.!
To understand better, take a toy drum. Bang on diaphragm with various intensity blows. First strike gently with your hands. Then blow slightly harder with the cords. Then very hard on so. In all the cases, see the diaphragm vibrates according to the intensity of the blow and then it produces the sound. This is analogous to the ear.
The human ear can detect sounds in the range of 20Hz-20KHz. These are called Audible Sounds. Eg: Music, Instruments, Crackers.
The eardrum senses the vibrations of sound. It sends vibrations to the inner ear. From there, the signal goes to the brain. That is how we hear.
Causes------------------
Reasoning------------------
The sound waves passes through the ear canal to a thin membrane called eardrum. The eardrum vibrates. The vibrations are amplified by the three bones of the middle ear calledhammer, anvil and stirrup. Middle ear then transmits the sound waves to the inner ear. The brain then interprets the signals as sound.

Property------------------
Letï¿½s start with the guitar. Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibration of their strings. This sound is amplified by the guitarï¿½s hollow body, and the different strings each produce a different frequency ï¿½ and thus different pitch ï¿½ of sound.
The neck of a guitar contains anywhere from 12 to 24 frets. By pressing on each of these frets, the player changes the tension of the string, leading to a new frequency and a different pitch of note or chord.
On a piano, sound is created in almost exactly the same way. Instead of plucking the strings, piano players push keys which trigger hammers that push the strings inside the piano. The body of the piano amplifies this sound just like the body of a guitar.
Instead of using human energy to create vibration, like the plucking motion used to play a guitar or the tap of a piano keyï¿½s hammer, speakers convert electrical energy into vibration which, in turn, produces sound. Digital audio production software often includes a live view of sound waves as they are playing. The peaks in this view are the periods at which sound is loudest. This is when your speakers will be vibrating the most.

waves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definition------------------
Propagation of Sound When an object vibrates, the particles around the medium vibrate. The particle in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position.
The disturbance produced by the vibrating body travels through the medium but the particles do not move forward themselves. A wave is a disturbance which moves through a medium by the vibration of the particles of the medium. So sound is considered as a wave. Sound waves Require medium for transmission.
Sound waves are called mechanical waves When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it forming a region of high pressure called compression (C). When the vibrating object moves backward, it forms a region of low pressure called rarefaction(R).
A vibrating object producing a series of compressions (C) and rarefaction (R). In these waves the particles move back and forth parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. Such waves are called longitudinal waves.
Sound propagates in a medium as a series of compressions (C) and rare factions (R). Compressions are the regions of high pressure and density where the particles are crowded andare represented by the upper portion of the curve called crest. Rarefactions are the regions of low pressure and density where the particles are spread out and are represented by the lower portion of the curve called trough.

Definition------------------
Not all objects are attracted to magnets. Objects that are attracted by a magnet are said to be magnetic, e.g., iron and nickel. Objects that are not attracted by a magnet, are said to be non-magnetic, e.g., wood and plastic.
When two magnets are brought close to each other, they are either pulled towards each other, or pushed away from each other. When the magnets are pulled towards each other, they are said to attract each other. When they are pushed away from each other, they are said to repel each other. Whether the magnets attract or repel depends on which poles of the magnets are facing each other.
When unlike poles of the magnets (N-S or S-N) are brought close to each other, they attract. This is called attraction
There are two types of magnets: temporary and permanent. Magnets that retain their magnetic properties only for a short period of time are called temporary magnets. Magnets that retain their magnetic properties for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.

If a magnet is allowed to move freely, it comes to rest in a direction very close to the Earth’s North-South direction. This property of a magnet was used to find directions on the surface of the Earth by travellers. An instrument with a magnet that is used to find directions is called magnetic compass.
It has a small magnetic needle at its centre. This needle can rotate freely and always points in the Earth’s North-South direction. Different directions (north, south, east, and west) are marked on the compass. Figure 12.3 shows how one can find directions using a magnetic compass
Do you know why a freely suspended magnet always points in the Earth’s north-south direction? It behaves like it is under the influence of another magnet. But where is this other magnet? It is the Earth itself. This alignment happens because of the influence of the Earth, which itself acts like a giant bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). It influences all the magnets (within its region of influence) to align themselves along its North-South direction.
When two magnets are brought close to each other, they are either pulled towards each other, or pushed away from each other. When the magnets are pulled towards each other, they are said to attract each other. When they are pushed away from each other, they are said to repel each other.
